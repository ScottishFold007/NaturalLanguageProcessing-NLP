1 - Nenokkadine (2014) - IMDb, Its like watching a color film during the black and white times.,s-vinaykumar12345610,January/2014,9/10,"Its the same excitement that bring to every tollywood movie guy when they have watched a film in full 'Color' during the times of 'black and white' cinematography. Usually most of the 'Tollywood' films has typically a nice formulae. Start with a fight, a song, chase the villains, two more fights, 10 jokes, fight in climax and END. But This film is completely different. A film that could set standards to the upcoming ones. A completely different road that has been put up this film. And this might be the one of the best films in Tollywood that makes you to be in the script till the end. This not like other movies which defines the laws of the physics. And every other director who are using the usual formulae should see this and try to change the way how it has been taken up by Mr Sukumar. Its awesome. Its a huge leap for tollywood. Excellent cinematography, excellent script (thou it has loosened a bit in the middle) excellent direction, Most stunning background music and good crew. I must also appreciate the Background Music. Mr Devi Sri Prasad has really done an excellent experiment with tuning the same music tone and using it for the different versions. So, when you come out of the theatre, you can still hear the same music. This is awesome. And to understand it you must put your complete concentration on the movie. If some body tells you that this is crap them it means that they haven't seen movies like Dark Knight/Inception/Breaking Bad which give the nostalgia in the end.

A Sound of Thunder (2005) - IMDb, Prepare to thunder towards the exit,TheMovieMark1,September/2005,4/10,"What exactly is the sound of thunder? If this movie is any indication then it's the sound of moviegoers thundering towards the exit, demanding their money back. Yes, the movie is that bad.""Hey Johnny, how bad is it?"" This movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury wishes he could invent a time machine so that he could go back in time and NOT write the short story, thus preventing this movie from ever being made.""Whoa, that bad?"" Worse. In fact, this movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury might kill himself just so he can roll over in his grave. I know you think I'm trying to be cute, but I'm being serious. This was one of the strangest movie experiences I've had in quite a while. The problem is that I went into the movie expecting to enjoy it. I thought it had the chance to be pretty good. So at the very start I was trying to make excuses for what was unraveling on screen.The first thing to induce unintentional laughter was the fact that Ben Kingsley (the owner of the time traveling safari who's only interested in how much money he can make) looks like Bob Barker. Nice poofy white wig, Ben. Oh well, no big deal, I can laugh that off. Then we're introduced to the first CGI dinosaur of the movie. ""Hmm, that sure looks really fake,"" I thought. ""Oh, I know! It's supposed to be fake. They're tricking the hunters into thinking the dinosaur is real, but it's mechanical or something."" Nope. Imagine my sheer horror when I came to the realization that the dinosaur was supposed to be real. Wow. At this point I started to get nervous.Then came the incredibly bad green screens. Folks, these are some of the worst green screens I've ever seen. My words cannot do justice to how fake they looked. Some might even say they looked faker than those things Pamela Anderson tries to pass off as breasts. When you can tell that the actors are walking on a treadmill then you have serious issues that are long past addressing. I was absolutely shocked at what I was witnessing. Honestly, I started to get confused and thought, ""What in the world is going on? This movie cost $80 million to make, there's no way it can look this bad."" Where there's a will, there's a way, and somebody must've had a strong will to make this as cheesy and as goofy as they could because I cannot come up with any other explanation.I actually like the concept of the movie - the butterfly effect - the theory that something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can produce long-term effects on a dynamical system. However, this movie presents the theory in the most outlandish, most unbelievable way imaginable. Sorry, but I just didn't buy it. One of the scientists in the movie argues that if you kill a bee, then that bee can't pollinate a flower, and an animal will not be able to eat that flower, thus that animal will die and can cause damaging long-term effects. Um, if ""Flower A"" never blossoms then an animal that's hungry will just go find ""Flower B"" and eat that. I don't think the animal will immediately die AND CAUSE HUMANS TO TURN INTO ALIEN-LIKE CREATURES!!! Come on.So the movie decides to take the ""butterfly effect"" to the most extreme depths that it possibly can - fine, whatever. What *really* bothered me is it doesn't care to explain why killing the butterfly resulted in the world being taken over by horribly rendered CGI creatures. It would have at least been nice to have an explanation as to why and how such drastic changes took place because of one simple butterfly.The butterfly would've been killed in a volcano that erupts right before they head back to the time machine anyway, so how do you explain that? Well, if your name is A Sound of Thunder then you don't. You just say, ""Here's the premise, now we're just going to become a monster movie and have the good guys be chased by bat monsters in the dark."" Well, I'd be interested in hearing what's said when this movie becomes one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) flops of the year.At about the halfway point I realized that there was no need to continue to rationalize why the movie appeared to be so bad. I accepted the fact that in this case appearances were not deceiving and this was just a really horrible movie. If you can accept that from the start then there is plenty of unintentional laughter to be had.Once our heroes started being chased by weird ape/bat/dinosaur hybrids, I just kicked back, laughed, and shook my head at the fact that the CGI is as bad (if not worse) than what you see in Sci-Fi Original movies starring Lorenzo Lamas and Michael Paré. I wish I were exaggerating.I honestly don't know how this movie was allowed to achieve such mediocrity. You know when one of the characters starts off with an American accent, then begins to fluctuate between American and British accents, and then eventually settles into her native British accent that everybody involved has obviously thrown in the towel and said, ""Screw it, let's just get this over with."" You would think that in the year 2005 a movie with an $80 million budget wouldn't look more like a movie that was made on an $8 million budget. I'm sorry, but CGI this awkward on this size of a budget is just inexcusable. Way to go Hollywood.

After Earth (2013) - IMDb, Kitai Litter,jadepietro4,June/2013,3/10,"This film is not recommended.  Father doesn't always know best, the latest result being After Earth, a  vanity project that Will Smith has concocted for his son, Jaden. This  wobbly sci-fi tale of survival will certainly test both Mr. and Mr.  Smith's star power. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who  continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still  tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the  director crashes and burns.   This is not to say that After Earth is hopelessly clichéd, it's just  hopeless. Shymalan's well- made film has some striking imagery, mostly  of panoramic vistas, but his ill-conceived screenplay (co-written with  Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound.  Adding to that, his main star and one of the film's producers, Papa  Smith, pushes nepotism to its limits with this unoriginal dreck. (He is  also given story credit for this silliness.) It's not just that this  film has no Will power, it just has too much of it, both on screen and  off.  Will Smith plays the fearless Cypher Raige, a no-nonsense military  commando sent on a mission with his newt of a son, Kitai, played by  Jaden Smith. Cypher is disappointed with his son's lack of achievement  as a cadet and their relationship is a bit strained, just like the  acting. The Smiths obviously look the part and act the part with the  same stilted delivery. Like father, like son. Unfortunately (for us),  they crash land on the apocalyptic Planet Earth. Cypher is injured with  two broken legs, but pain is not an option. However a better script  would have helped matters. Kitai must now go into rescue mode, wearing  his amazing technicolor space suit, fighting beasts and creatures along  the way to becoming a man.   On his journey of self-awareness, Kitai contends with imminent peril:  giant baboons, poisonous leeches, carnivorous tigers, and such. He  needs to deal with the fluctuating below-freezing temperatures and an  active volcano too. Life is hard. Kitai even battles a monster called  the Ursa, a predator that hunts by sensing fear. (If the creature could  instead sense the smorgasbord of bad acting on its plate, the Ursa  would never go hungry again.) The elder Smith underacts and speaks in  annoying solemn platitudes while the younger Smith overacts in a  squeaky nasal voice that only a teenager can tolerate.   The art direction is mind-numbing. The futuristic sets are bargain  basement knockoffs of Disney World's Tomorrowland, circa 1960...very  unimaginative with an overabundance of Rubbermaid-influenced interiors  and enough flowing linen sheets to make one think that Bed, Bath, and  Beyond had given the filmmakers a cut-rate deal for some product  endorsements. All of the special effects are barely adequate and not  the least bit compelling. After Earth has a strange lethargic  listlessness throughout its short length. The film never builds any  real tension or suspense. It's just so dull and unrelenting in its  stupidity.  After Earth is the type of film that gives the sci-fi genre a bad name.  Shyamalan and the Smiths might want to use other aliases after creating  this debacle. Let's hope they refine their own survival skills when  making another film. After Earth is strictly Ursa Minor.   So dear moviegoers, heed the film's tag-line: ""Danger is real, Fear is  a choice"". You have been sufficiently warned about the real dangers in  viewing After Earth...Fear not, it's still in your control.

Not explained how they came to be roving around Chile, but they have money and not a lot of responsibility. You would imagine that after thirty minutes these guys are going to be the major characters. Surprise! Only one of these guys survives any distance into the disaster and during the latter half of the movie the main characters are three girls who are considerably less fleshed out than the guys we met first off.That's not the only narrative flaw. Why is there such an effort made to introduce the girl with the wu-tang tattoo. Is she going to feature in the rest of the film? Nope. Are any of the character backgrounds actually important to the story or how they act under pressure? Not really.

Aliens (1986) - IMDb, A masterpiece - one of the best epic-action films of all time my personal favorite,ivo-cobra813,February/2018,10/10,"Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death.

Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it.

Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) - IMDb," Brilliant, Mind-Bending Storytelling",call_me_grudge31,December/2007,2/10,"From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed they released a PG-13 Alien/Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received by any means.Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead. Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with the man-in-the-suit Alien seen in the old films. The actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. But what about the effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:""To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.""And everyone lived happily ever after.

Anaconda (1997) - IMDb, An insult to anacondas...,Matrixgirl04K104,November/2001,1/10,"Now, I am a snake lover.  I love snakes of all kinds, even when they are in my house.  It pains me to kill them or see them killed.  And when I heard this movie would be out, I thought ""Uh oh.""  But I watched it anyway. Please beat me.  Allow me to point out everything that went wrong with this tripe.  And these are spoilers, by the way.1)  Anacondas have never gotten any bigger than 40 feet on record.  How big was this one?2)  An anaconda is a very muscular predator.  It can kill a crocodile by SUFFOCATION NOT BONE CRUSHING.  Any snake, as a matter of fact, does not have the power to crush bones or pop veins.  They just don't.  They just suffocate their prey by compressing their lungs and windpipe.3)  Although they are very stong, it is impossible for the snake to pick up a human being, lift it up, and swallow it upright.  They can't.  It has to do with physics and biology.4)  It takes a snake a very long time to swallow its dinner.  It can take up to an hour for it to swallow a crocodile.  And that means that it would take nearly 3/4 of an hour to swallow these people.  If it felt compelled to go after them, first of all.5)  A SNAKE IS NOT A FISH.  It cannot stay under water for that long, and it does not go after the smell of blood.  A snake hunts by sight and the smell of the animal.  They made this snake out to be a shark.  And even if they did go after blood, that monkey was dead.  They go after movement.6)  A snake will vomit its food if it feels threatened.  It serves a confusion tactic for enemies.  Did this snake feel threatened?  No.  And when they do vomit, it does not fly out like that guy did.7)  Do you know how long it takes a snake to digest a meal?  When a python eats a boar, it goes without food for almost a year.  That means that that anaconda would be pretty well-fed after the first victim.8)  An anaconda does not kill for the fun of it.  They leave that to humans.9)  An anaconda will not let go of its current prey, which is still alive, and go after something dead.  They know better.10)  An anaconda can climb trees and move very quickly.  They do not fly up pipes.11)  And, lastly, an anaconda is not invincible.  I think shooting it in the head will do it in.  You will not need to torch it and take a pick-axe to its head.This was tripe, as I said before.  Do not watch this.  Just to tell you how bad it is, I think that it was pretty worthy of the MST3K bunch.",0,"[snake, lover, love, snake, kind, even, house, pain, kill, see, kill, heard, movie, would, thought, uh, oh, watch, anyway, please, beat, allow, point, everything, go, wrong, tripe, spoiler, anaconda, never, gotten, big, foot, record, big, one, anaconda, muscular, predator, kill, crocodile, suffocation, bone, crush, snake, matter, fact, power, crush, bone, pop, vein, suffocate, prey, compress, lung, although, stong, impossible, snake, pick, human, lift, swallow, upright, physic, take, snake, long, time, swallow, dinner, take, hour, swallow, crocodile, mean, would, take, nearly, hour, swallow, people, felt, compel, go, first, snake, fish, stay, water, long, go, smell, blood, snake, hunt, sight, smell, animal, ...]","[now, i, am, a snake lover, i love snakes, of, all kinds, even when, they, are, in, my house, it, pains, me, to, kill, them, see, them, killed, when, i, heard, this movie, would be, out, i, thought, i, watched, it, anyway, please, beat me, allow, me, to, point, everything, went, wrong, with, this tripe, these are spoilers, by, anacondas, have never gotten, bigger, than, 40 feet, on, record, how, big, was, an anaconda, is, a very muscular predator, it, can kill, a crocodile, by, suffocation not bone, crushing, any snake, as, a matter, of, fact, does not have, the power, to, crush, bones or pop veins, they, just do, not, they, just suffocate, their prey, by, compressing, their lungs, windpipe.3, although, they, are, very stong, it, is, impossible, for, the snake, to, pick, up, a human being, lift, it, ...]",-0.010390100789512564,-0.08097397174650316,1,0,0

Anniyan (2005) - IMDb, Anniyan is what every movie wants to be: An entertainer,msnindia22,June/2005,10/10,"Shankar and Vikram have done a fantastic job. Director Shankar is turning into a professional high-quality perfectionist. Actor Vikram, charged with a National award for Best Actor (2004) is on a roll. His performance is classy and comparable to many great actors of Tamil cinema.Anniyan is definitely worth watching at least once. Forget about the critics who list past movies from which various aspects of Anniyan (like concept, theme, stunts, music) was inspired (or copied). It is easier to make the original than to make a copy as the original serves as a hard benchmark. It is hard to replicate something while maintaining audience interest. Shankar does this job to a more-than-satisfying extent.Besides, when great directors like Steven Spielberg copy past movies (War of the worlds) with the confidence of providing the viewers something worthwhile to watch, I don't see anything wrong in Shankar's Anniyan. Yet, Anniyan is NOT a complete copy and it is definitely MORE than the sum of its parts.Anniyan has stunts that were never before seen in any Tamil movie. Shankar has provided the opportunity to the (uneducated mass of) Tamil audience of watching world-class stunts in a movie that they can understand (as against most Hollywood flicks that have the action but make no sense to them). So what, if it has been copied? Matrix Reloaded being largely mystifying and unexplained, even to most native-English speakers, could not justify to the (masses of the) Tamil audience as to why all the action exists!!??. But that is not the case with Anniyan.To sum it all up, Anniyan is what a movie should really be. A classy entertainer.

Heres where Anniyan fails,Plot - Essentially a repeat of Indian and Mudhalvan and not as good as either by far. This time around, the people get blamed for their behavior in society. When you think about it, it did a little bit of potential and the movie could have been a bit more violent and used some better ideas devoid of clichés. All the familiar stories show up.Acting - The worst ever. The bad deeds done by society are all unconvincing, look intentional for the camera and are done by too many familiar actors who you simply can't picture playing such roles. Vikram's acting is highly overrated and utterly stupid as that Remo character. In all of Shankar's movies, the acting was super realistic to the extent that it shocked you. Not here. It was lame. Prakash Raj just plays himself and is an unconvincing police officer.Action - Horrid, comical style fight scenes with a 3rd rate repeat of matrix and kill bill fight scenes with 1/50th the budget. The stunt and camera guys really ripped Shankar off.Comedy - Very good. Vivek keeps the movie going. Some other characters also deliver good comedy. Songs - No AR Rehman. Nuff said.Special effects - Why do stupid 3D Graphics and CGI done by the worst ever teams keep showing up? They have no point whatsoever. They are embarrassing. Did Shankar really think that the audience was dumb enough to buy that Anniyan 3D animated an entire world using only Macromedia Flash?If you look at Boys, you can see that Shankar really wanted to make his movies as graphic and realistic as possible. This movie is neither. It tries to be and look violent but poor screenplay and poor cinematography ruin it.

Athadu (2005) - IMDb," By the end of the movie, the film totally lost me and I gave up...",MartinHafer16,March/2017,3/10,"The fact that I am not an Indian and don't live in India is something you should consider when you read my review. I do lover Indian films and have seen a couple hundred...but I am definitely an outsider. ""Athadu"" is a film I enjoyed during the first half of the movie. But as the film progressed, my interest waned greatly. And the CGI- intensive ending really, really annoyed me.The film begins with a sweet little kid, Nandu, murdering some gangster type. Obviously this is NOT an ordinary little psychopath. Soon a guy sees the kid's psychotic promise and gets him to become a contract killer. The credits appear and then suddenly the boy has grown to be a studly man. He is now a super-assassin. In fact he's so good that he's approached with a bizarre proposition...he's to deliberately make an unsuccessful attempt on a politician's life. They explain that the injury will guarantee the guy an easy win in the election. However, when Nandu is setting up and readying for his shot with a rifle and scope, someone else shoots and kills one of the folk!! Almost instantly, the police KNOW where Nandu is and try to catch him...he's obviously a patsy for someone's evil plot.After evading the police, he finds himself in a train with a talkative man named Pardhu. It seems that Pardhu has been estranged from his small town family for over a decade and now he's finally returning. However, after conveniently telling Nardu EVERYTHING about himself, Pardhu is killed by police fire as shots ring out. Nardu escapes again and makes himself to the town where Pardhu was headed...with the intention of him assuming Pardu's life and identity. This is a nice setup and I liked this portion of the movie. But when the super-clichéd lady love interest is introduced, the quality and style of the movie changes. It had been an exciting and gritty crime film...but now a sappy and ridiculous romance. She turns out to be the most spoiled, obnoxious and self-absorbed woman I have EVER seen in a movie...and, inexplicably, you know that faux Pardhu will fall for her. This makes no sense...and having him KILL her would have made much, much more sense. What also doesn't make a lot of sense is seeing a serial killer slowly changing into a swell guy who comes to love his new family!While all this is bad, it gets MUCH worse at the end with a giant shootout with many baddies and faux Pardhu taking them all one and, naturally, winning. This is bad enough but so much of this is done in slow-motion, with crazy ridiculous CGI. It is so over-stylized and dumb that I found myself praying for the movie to end!!!The bottom line is that I know you will a few clichés in Indian movies...they are so often formulaic. But the awfulness of the woman took it from formula to the ridiculous...and the ending was hellishly bad. It's a shame....it really DID start off very well.",0,"[fact, indian, live, india, something, consider, read, review, lover, indian, film, see, couple, hundred, definitely, outsider, athadu, film, enjoy, first, half, movie, film, progress, interest, wan, greatly, intensive, end, really, really, annoyed, film, begin, sweet, little, kid, nandu, murder, gangster, type, obviously, ordinary, little, psychopath, soon, guy, see, kid, psychotic, promise, get, become, contract, killer, credit, appear, suddenly, boy, grown, studly, man, fact, good, approach, bizarre, proposition, deliberately, make, unsuccessful, attempt, politician, life, explain, injury, guarantee, guy, easy, win, election, however, nandu, set, ready, shot, rifle, scope, someone, else, shoot, kill, one, folk, almost, instantly, police, know, nandu, try, catch, ...]","[the fact, that, i, am, not, an indian, do not live, in, india, is something, you, should consider, when, you, read, my review, i, do lover, indian films, have seen, a couple, hundred...but i, am, definitely, an outsider, athadu, is, a film i, enjoyed, during, the first half, of, the movie, as, the film, progressed, my interest, waned, greatly, the cgi, intensive ending, really, really annoyed, me.the film, begins, with, a sweet little kid, nandu, murdering, some gangster type, obviously, is, not, an ordinary little psychopath, soon, a guy, sees, the kid, psychotic promise, gets, him, to, become, a contract killer, the credits, appear, then suddenly, the boy, has grown, to, be, a studly man, he, is, now, a super-assassin, in, fact he, is, so good, that, he, is approached, with, a bizarre proposition...he, is, to, deliberately make, an unsuccessful attempt, on, a politician, life, they, explain, that, the injury, will guarantee, guy, an easy win, in, ...]",0.003184952938309426,0.05544207907707384,1,1,3

Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) - IMDb, Baahubali is Indian Grand Spectacle,prabhatrayal9,July/2015,8/10,"I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places). I didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it. All the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.The background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR) I would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.The quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.But the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voilà we will have a SPECTACULAR film.Baahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian ""Baahubali"".So in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it.

Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) - IMDb, Valiant effort but lacks content,gkumar-leo20,November/2015,5/10,"To be portrayed as the biggest Indian spectacle till date is a heavy accolade to hold, let alone achieve. And baahubali is definitely not up to the mark.Let's look at the movie objectively:1) Starting with the most talked about aspect of the movie VFX/CGI. The CGI is so over the top that it felt like a badly edited video game at times. For instance, the scene in which Baahubali is running away from the guards in the fort. Loud and showy landscapes can not be termed as spectacular CGI. It should merge seamlessly with the movie and CGI stands out like a sore thumb in this one.2)Acting: Its loud and crass to say the least. The reactions of all characters after every dialogue reminds a bit of the daily soaps.3)StoryLine: Its old and repetitive from a 1000 other movies of the same genre. A messiah who comes to save the day. Yes, that's never been done before in Indian cinema.However, despite all the above points Baahubali puts in a valiant effort. But to compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit with the sheer depth of Tolkien's work is sacrilege. No where near that league.Only recommended for the faithful.

Baby (2015) - IMDb, A thriller that India will always be proud of !,gourav0907199423,January/2015,10/10,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",1,"[though, categorize, movie, basis, region, country, mention, title, regard, india, proud, movie, heard, people, yell, social, medium, public, low, standard, indian, movie, specially, thriller, either, lack, thrill, copy, hollywood, agree, occasion, one, would, strongly, recommend, people, complain, lack, good, movie, bollywood, go, watch, else, stop, complain, movie, describes, big, agenda, world, face, right, terrorism, best, way, could, story, comprises, many, small, incident, bound, together, slickly, feel, smooth, flow, script, lose, hustle, go, front, u, keen, know, come, next, first, half, make, plot, movie, second, half, unleashes, execution, every, scene, complement, predecessor, biting, nail, without, even, notice, last, hour, full, thrill, ...]","[though, i, do not categorize, movies, on, the basis, of, their region or country, i, had mentioned, this title, regarding, india, being, proud, of, this movie, is, because, i, have heard, people, yelling, in, social media, in, public, about, the low standards, of, indian movies specially thrillers, which either lack thrill, are copied, from, hollywood, i agree, to, them, o, most, occasions, i, would strongly recommend, people, complain, about, the lack, of, good movies, in, bollywood, to, go, watch, it, else stop complaining, on to, the movie, it, describes, the biggest agenda world, is facing, right now, terrorism, in, best way it, could, the story comprises, of, many small incidents, are bound together so slickly that, we, feel, the smooth flow, of, script, we, are lost in, the hustle going, on in, front, of, us, are, keen, to, know, is coming, next, first half, makes, the plot, for, the movie, the second half, unleashes, the execution, each and every scenes, complements, its predecessor and we, ...]",0.12855745514162514,-0.09010399289623944,0,0,0
Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) - IMDb, Finally something refreshing!,ranjanac17,July/2015,10/10,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners.

Batman & Robin (1997) - IMDb, an especially bad movie,Gambitt7,May/2001,1/10,"I've rated several hundred movies on IMDB, and overall, I go easy on them. Most of the so-so ones get a 5 or 6.

Batman Begins (2005) - IMDb, Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise,pyrocitor15,August/2005,10/10,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",1,"[sicken, past, see, batman, movie, franchise, slowly, dig, way, early, grave, quality, tim, burton, film, series, pretty, much, go, toilet, begin, horrifically, campy, age, armored, arnold, schwarzenegger, toss, pun, batman, seem, try, embarrass, fact, costume, nipple, could, warner, brother, producer, hope, resurrect, franchise, pretend, never, happen, start, whole, series, talented, director, compelling, story, capable, cast, enter, christopher, nolan, mastermind, behind, widely, praise, one, innovative, film, decade, screenwriter, nolan, creates, richly, dark, atmospheric, world, batman, inhabit, similar, burton, film, less, cartoony, film, screenplay, write, nolan, david, goyer, quality, stuff, true, dialog, exchange, seem, kind, contrive, particularly, wayne, liam, neeson, character, ducard, ...]","[it, sickened, me, in, past, to, see, the batman movie franchise, slowly digging, it, is way, to, an early grave, after, the quality tim burton films, the series, pretty, much, went, the toilet, beginning, a horrifically campy age, of, bat credit-cards, ', an armored arnold schwarzenegger, tossing, cringe-worthy puns, at, a batman, seemed, to, be trying, not, to, be embarrassed, by, the fact, that, his costume, had, nipples, so, could warner, brothers producers, hope, to, do, to, resurrect, the franchise, pretend, it, never happened, start, the whole series, over, again, with, a talented director, compelling story, capable cast, enter, christopher nolan, the mastermind, behind, momento, widely praised, as, of, the most innovative films, of, the decade, as, director/co, screenwriter, nolan, creates, richly dark, atmospheric world, for, batman, to, inhabit, similar, to that of, the burton films, less cartoony, the film, screenplay, written, by, nolan, david, s. goyer, is quality, stuff, it, is, true, ...]",-0.0986201242064471,-0.048103329728479756,1,0,1

Bitch Slap (2009) - IMDb, Weak satire/homage of material that was already a spoof and satire of itself to start with.,dbborroughs10,January/2010,3/10,"It begins with one of our heroines sitting bruised and broken in the middle of carnage and looking up and wondering aloud how it all came to this.I was wondering the same thing.This is a send up/homage/satire of the bad girls gone worse genre that Russ Meyer did so well (for some tastes anyway). It has three well endowed girls going after a fortune held by a crime lord and chronicles the death and destruction that follows. Its very tongue in cheek with an over abundance of close ups of the female form, pithy dialog and lots of violence.The trouble is that the film is essentially sending up material that was sending itself up to start. Meyer was a very knowing filmmaker and its kind of hard to be any more knowing then he was. The other trouble is that in order to send up the material the filmmakers here have tried to take an intentionally ""bad"" take on some things. the bump up and inflate things to the point of silliness. The trouble was that the type of film that they are sending up were more often then not played painfully straight which is what made them so much fun. If you play the material with any sort of real knowing the films become unbearable (Russ Meyer was one of the very few people who ever managed to make the knowingness work).I found the film to be a waste of my time. I get the jokes, I get the idea behind it (I could probably quote you the films this is riffing on) but I don't think it works at all. No thats not true, this is a five minute SNL sketch stretched to 100 minutes. This is one of the couple dozen recent and semi recent films that have been made in the wake of Quentin Tarantino's re-purposing exploitation classics as mainstream films (think Grindhouse, Kill Bill or Inglorious Basterds). Everyone seems to think that they can do what Tarantino does, but its clear that few people understand that he's not just sending up the schlock masterpieces but taking the good parts and making something more out of them (And as much as I complain about Tarantino I must insist that I do so because I think he is wasting his talent).Frankly there are better ways to spend your time, like watching a Russ Meyer film or one of the real exploitation films this film tries to emulate and send up (Better yet, go find one of the films by the late great Claudia Jennings and you'll see how unnecessary this film was).",0,"[begin, one, heroine, sit, bruise, broken, middle, carnage, look, wonder, aloud, come, wonder, send, bad, girl, go, bad, genre, rus, meyer, well, taste, anyway, three, well, endow, girl, go, fortune, held, crime, lord, chronicle, death, destruction, follows, tongue, cheek, abundance, close, ups, female, form, pithy, dialog, lot, trouble, film, essentially, send, material, send, start, meyer, know, filmmaker, kind, hard, know, trouble, order, send, material, filmmaker, try, take, intentionally, bad, take, thing, bump, inflate, thing, point, silliness, trouble, type, film, send, often, played, painfully, straight, make, much, fun, play, material, sort, real, know, film, become, unbearable, rus, meyer, one, people, ever, ...]","[it, begins, with, of, our heroines, sitting bruised, broken, in, the middle, of, carnage, looking, up, wondering, aloud how, it, came, to, this.i was wondering, the same thing.this, is, a send up/homage/satire, of, the bad girls, gone, worse genre, that, russ meyer, did, so well, for, some tastes, anyway, it, has, well endowed, girls, going, after, a fortune, held, by, a crime lord, chronicles, the death, destruction, follows, its very tongue, in, cheek, with, an over abundance, close, ups, of, the female form, pithy dialog, lots, of, violence.the trouble, is, that, the film, is essentially sending, up, material, was sending, itself, up, to, start, meyer, was, very knowing, filmmaker and its kind, of, hard, to, be, more, knowing, then, he, was, the other trouble, is, that in, order, to, send, up, material, the filmmakers, here have tried, to, take, intentionally, bad, take, on, ...]",-0.11985071132113842,0.11389598333559592,1,1,3
Black Friday (2004) - IMDb, A rare foray by an Indian film maker into gritty real-life drama,infinitelyprolonged13,May/2005,10/10,"Films based on books are a rarity in India. Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.The movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators' lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it's not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that's really commendable.I haven't seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.The actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren't new to him.The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.To finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines.",1,"[film, base, book, rarity, india, probably, account, huge, amount, movie, without, coherent, screenplay, india, churn, black, friday, hand, exception, make, film, maker, movie, revolve, around, investigation, follow, horrify, bombay, bomb, blast, also, show, perpetrator, life, incident, take, long, time, get, censor, board, difficult, imagine, see, movie, movie, try, portray, everything, way, actually, happen, least, book, say, happen, succeed, technically, movie, top, league, compare, hindi, movie, though, edit, choppy, place, music, indian, ocean, brilliant, importantly, suit, plot, despite, length, movie, director, never, loses, grip, really, see, satya, sorry, familiar, anurag, kashyap, work, though, also, dialogue, believe, yuva, see, consider, smoke, generates, ...]","[films, based, on, books, are, a rarity, in, india, probably, that, accounts, for, the huge amount, of, movies, without, any coherent screenplay, that, india, churns, out, black friday, on, the other hand, is, an exception, will make, any film maker, proud.the movie, revolving, around, the investigation, following, the horrifying bombay bomb blasts, also showing, the perpetrators, lives, just, before, after, the incident, took, a long time, to, get, through, the censor board, it, is, not difficult, to, imagine, why, once, you, have seen, the movie, the movie, tries, to, portray everything, the way it, actually happened, at, least, as, the book, says, it, happened, succeeds, technically, the movie, is, top league, compared, to, other, hindi movies, though, the editing, is, choppy, in, places, the music, by, indian ocean, is, brilliant, more importantly, suits, the plot, despite, the length, of, movie, the director, never loses, grip, ...]",0.13065805631148075,-0.0353812388116408,0,2,2

No plots that make any kind of coherent sense, just a whole lot of people getting a great chance to overact with gusto and abandon. And since Cannonball Run II just about tripled the number of name players who did walk ons, it could be considered triple the fun. Folks like Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise who are the nominal stars, Jackie Chan, Jack Elam, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., and Jamie Farr make return appearances and a whole lot more get in on the fun.Farr who is carrying the prize money as the fabulously wealthy hedonistic idiot son of an Arab sheik played here by Ricardo Montalban gets to be the target of some gangster heist when the wise guys find out what he's carrying. At that point the contentious rivalries cease among the Cannonballers as they band together against a common foe and to retrieve their prize money.Along for the ride this time with Reynolds and DeLuise are a pair of ersatz nuns played by Shirley MacLaine and Marilu Henner.

Cannonball Run II (1984) - IMDb," No Race, No Chase",Smile_U_SOB8,August/2007,1/10,"This film has no race and no chase. Okay there is a race but it has really nothing to do with the movie. The first film of course is all about ""The Cannonball Run"", which is an illegal race from coast to coast, written by Brock Yates who, along with director Hal Needham, actually drove an ambulance across America - and it's Yates who invented the Cannonball Run. In the original, Burt and Dom use the very same ambulance; now we have a sequel which isn't written by Yates, and is as bad a sequel as I've yet to witness on screen. As mentioned, the actual coast to coast race has little to do with anything this time around. Instead there's a lame subplot about mobsters trying to hijack Jamie Farr's character, an Arab with tons of oil money who this time around is funding the prize at the finish line. So basically this is a comic mobster film with a bunch of actors thrown in who are driving cars. Jack Elam, who is incredible in the first film, is thrown in as wallpaper. Burt and Dom are horrible and lazy; you can tell they were just doing the film for a paycheck. Shirley Maclaine and Marilu Henner play actresses dressed as nuns, and we have to sit through people doing double-takes as these impostor penguins curse in public. Boring. Horrible. Jackie Chan is even ruined this time around. In the first film Roger Moore plays a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore, and thus he drives a gadget filled car, ala Bond. This time around, Chan, who had some gadgets of his own in the original, has even more gadgets as he's basically replacing the Moore/Bond character from the original. And his driver is Richard Kiel, best known as Bond nemesis ""Jaws"". Chan's car even goes under water, just like Bond's car in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (which featured Kiel). Other contestants include an ape teamed up with Tony Danza. All I have to ask Tony is: Didn't ""Going Ape"" teach you not to work with primates? Jamie Farr's character is ruined because he's too involved; his sheik was far better as a cameo in the original. And Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr are totally wasted this time, disguised as cops instead of priests, and they don't even get into any trouble. Burt and Dom are dressed as soldiers; Burt is a general and Dom is a private. They pick up Jim Nabors along the way, as ""Private Lyle"" (guess what they're spoofing here?) and his cameo is as useless as an air conditioner in an igloo. It doesn't feel as if there is any ""need"" to win the race for any of the characters. You forget there is even a race at all. Man, I tell you, this is one of the worst sequels - if not the worst sequel ever, ever, ever made. Avoid it at all costs.

Casino Royale (2006) - IMDb," The best Bond i have ever seen, Daniel Craig's first best Bond 007 my third favorite",ivo-cobra825,November/2017,10/10,"Casino Royale (2006) is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film, the real Bond film unlike lackluster sh**y Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death, from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action, action, action and even more action. Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. I'm a hard-core James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mind-blowing. It is highly entertaining, espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day (2002) producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie, and producers had already decided to reboot the long-running spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006's Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond's girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond's first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper's character seems ambiguous, impudent and complicated. One night-slumped in the shower fully clothed, radiating inner beauty-her quiet look is capable to melt Bond's cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another, she disconcerts him with her pretty 'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter 'bleeding chips at the poker tournament:' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the 'contact' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill, Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007, and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, Montenegro, but things are not what they seem.Bond (Daniel Craig) is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb. While Bond chases him he has to jump on a several sky cranes and on a building to continue the chase. Real stunt performance from stunt man and actor Daniel Craig. He chases Mollaka to embassy in Madagascar and shots him and shoots a nearby gas tank makes a huge explosion and flees with Mollaka's bag, he finds his cell phone with text message the word ""ELLIPSIS."" A trail leads Bond to Nassau, Bahamas to Alex Dmitrios (Simon Abkarian) in which Bond seduces his wife Solange and find's out he goes to Miami USA. Bond pursues Dmitrios to Miami airport kills Dmitrios with a knife in self defense tracks down another bomber. Bond stops the terrorist and takes the bomb away from the airplane. Saves all the passengers and the plane. Great tanker truck chase on the airport. Great action sequence Bond saves over 200 lives in this movie that is why I love it so much. Bond stops the tanker before hitting the plane with all the gas and the bomb attached to it and he attaches bomb on a terrorist. Excellent action sequence! Bond has to fight Le Chiffre in high poker game with Felix Leiter. Bond kill's two black men in which Le Chiffre lost their money and single handle with fists kill's them. Bond is such a bad-ass in this movie. Le Chiffre and his blond girl Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poison Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond runs to his car for defibrillator but passes out. Vesper Lynd comes and save's his life. Bond comes back in to Casino finishes the game and beats Le Chiffre at the game. Bond drives Aston Martin DBS great action sequence.10/10 This movie is directed by Martin Campbell who directed GoldenEye my all time favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 film.

Casino Royale (2006) - IMDb," ""Bordello Royale""",sandy-kopi19,November/2006,1/10,"If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film, there is a problem.Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused. His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe ""they"" know some things I don't about 007, maybe I've been missing something about the character. Plus,the hype around the production was excellent,the rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that, as a long as you know what you're doing.But at the very first frame of the film,my original skepticism re-emerged:The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance, chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around, aiming his gun at the camera, taking the classic pose. Right then, I couldn't help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background(!) and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting: "" I am your NEW James Bond!"". ""Not yet,gentlemen"" did I think.Still, let's give them a second chance, here comes the long-awaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slow-motion,turning into flying hearts,spades,clubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing: where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes? Where are the girls? Gone !!! Why???!!! At this point, I feared the worst: did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond?! But here comes hope:James Bond chases a man through a building site,climbing on cranes, jumping and falling hard. Great, this might not be a real James Bond flick, but at least, we're in for some good entertainment. Right?Wrong: The rest of the film is nothing but a long (two and a half hours long!)demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character.No Monneypenny,no ""Q"",no ""R"", and every time ""M"" (Judi Drench) appears on the screen, the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he's doing and come back to his senses. Yet,all I could hear from her was: ""What have you done to James Bond? Who are you, blond man?! Why don't you ever smile? Why don't you ever say anything witty? How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone? How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes? How could you fall in love with such a boring girl? What do you want from us? Bring us back England's most precious hero!""The other characters barely exist: The villain, named Le Chiffre, is a card player who's task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat ? no. Why? He might be a villain, but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating! We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knows,maybe someday,we'll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary.Then I thought: ""I get it! His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player's cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl, in the background, who's eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision! Great!"". Was I right ? Of course not, that would be something you'd see in a James Bond film...But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond film:James Bond (let's keep using this name, for the lack of a better one) is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement, he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat, letting 007's ""genitals"" dangling from underneath (Yes,you heard right). Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty's favorite secret agent's nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape? Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer? No, he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.The torture may have stopped for Bond, but increases for me: Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper (yes, girlfriend) who tells him, to rebuild his pride, that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger, she would still love him. To which, the emasculated James Bond replies (watch out, humor coming your way): ""That's because you know what I can do with my little finger."" Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this never-ending-going-nowhere-story?! And don't we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens, the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals?There were other problems with the film of course,such as the boring story, and the fact that the casino (which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film) turned out to be so poorly exploited.Giving this film one star might not be fair (do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating?),but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong ""spirit"" and doesn't take in consideration that, unlike other movies, James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers, and that this rare fact deserves to be honored.Don't mess with MY James Bond.",0,"[consider, james, bond, fan, yet, enjoy, film, like, everyone, else, first, saw, daniel, craig, replace, pierce, brosnan, role, bit, confuse, ice, cold, look, seem, quite, stretch, image, james, bond, maybe, know, thing, maybe, miss, something, character, plus, hype, around, production, excellent, rumor, filmmaker, decide, dare, many, aspect, nothing, wrong, long, know, first, frame, film, original, skepticism, opening, scene, happens, sombre, black, white, cold, war, set, bond, make, spectacular, entrance, chat, enemy, finish, mission, fist, inside, dirty, public, restroom, bond, spin, around, aim, gun, camera, take, classic, pose, right, could, help, notice, restroom, tile, background, blond, muscular, hunk, center, screen, suggest, ...]","[if, you, consider, yourself a james bond, fan, yet enjoyed, this film, is, a problem.just, like, everyone, else, when, i first, saw, that, daniel craig, was, to, replace, pierce brosnan, in, the role, i, was, a bit, confused, his ice cold, looks seemed, to, be, quite, a stretch, from, the image we, have, of, james bond, maybe, they, know, some things, i do, not, about, maybe i, have been missing, something, about, the character, plus,the hype, around, the production, was excellent,the, rumor, was, that, the filmmakers, have decided, to, be, more daring, in, many aspects, nothing, wrong, with that, as, long as, you, know, you, are, doing.but, at, the very first frame, of, the film,my, original skepticism, re-emerged:the opening scene, happens, in, sombre black and, white cold war, setting, in, which bond, makes, no spectacular entrance, chatting, with, his enemy, finishing, the mission, with, his fists, inside, a...dirty public restroom, then bond, spins, ...]",-0.09038066969371134,0.03202847341047391,1,1,1

If you're in that boat, you're either being overly dramatic, or you really haven't seen many bad films. The acting isn't horrible, but you might cringe a few times - and don't expect any awards nominations. Where the film really falls short is the (lack of) character development.

This film does have a Tarantino-feel, but it's obviously not a Tarantino, nor does it sell itself as such.

The Raggedy Man / Red Hoodie Guy being one major oversight.)I feel like if you hadn't read the book to begin with, you'll probably find yourself getting lost too easily..

Cell (2016) - IMDb, Worst Adaptation Ever,joshuakyte-6040011,June/2016,1/10,"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of ""language"" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the ""zombies type people."" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake.

But, fun it was!I went in hoping for more of the satirical flair that made the first one enjoyable.  CA:FT delivered.  This is the way movies about campy TV shows *should* be made.  An over-the-top parody that keeps you gasping and laughing the entire time.If you want ""realistic"" action, this movie is NOT it.  This is a live-action cartoon, beautifully shot in a kinetic MTV style.  Cameos are numerous (""Is that Bruce Willis?""  ""Hey, Pink!"") and watch for plenty of little homages to various campy TV series of the same genre.Most of all, sit back and enjoy!  The three angels are as goofy as ever with their satire-sincerity and ""fierce"" poses.  They each have a distinct personality trait which helps all the little subplots keep moving along.The supporting cast was fine too.  Bernie Mac's Bosley was an improvement over the first.  Lots of laughs!  Demi's Madison character was okay, but I kept getting the impression she was trying too hard.  This is a parody and Madison should have been a hammed-up villainess, but Moore remained too seriously focused. This caused the character to seem out of step with the rest of the movie.  John Cleese was fine too.  His part was small and generally consisted of the tired joke of miscommunication about his daughter's (Liu) occupation.If you enjoyed the first Charlies Angels, see this!

Code Name: The Cleaner (2007) - IMDb, The user rating is 2.6. Thank God!,guyfromjerzee13,January/2007,2/10,"Cedric the Entertainer is certainly a talented comedian, but with a script this boring and stupid, even he couldn't breathe life into this horrible mess of a comedy. Despite the bad reviews, I was still slightly eager to check out the movie. The year has just started and already I have a candidate for the worst movies of 2007. The spy comedy has been done to death. And the fact that the writers had nothing new to bring to the table didn't help. I must've chuckled a total of 5 times, and received no laughs whatsoever. As the movie (thankfully) approached its conclusion, I jokingly thought to myself, ""This is probably one of those flicks that contains a gag reel over the closing credits."" Well...I was right! I frequently disapprove of gag reels over the credits of good movies. When you show a gag reel after a bad movie, it's like rubbing salt on a wound. The only part of this movie worth checking out is Nicolette Sheridan doing an erotic dance in her lingerie. If the movie ever makes it to HBO On Demand, I suggest you just fast-forward to that particular scene, mute the sound, and watch it in a loop. Yes, it's that friggin' hot! As for the comedy, expect your usual assortment of bland, crude, sitcom-style gags. If you can't see the punchlines to each gag coming a mile away, you might want to consider getting a cat scan. In one scene, a janitor (one of Cedric's co-workers) is interrogated by a federal agent in a restroom. The agent points a gun at him, urging him to give him some information about Cedric's character. The janitor is an aspiring rapper, and goes on a whole rant about how he wants to be shot, since he wants to be the first rapper to write his songs while in a coma. He bends over, begging the agent to shoot him in the backside. The agent eventually leaves the restroom, as the janitor keeps screaming out, ""Put a bullet in my a**! Put it in my a**! Put it in my as**!"" And--guess what--one of his fellow janitors strolls into the restroom as he continues to scream out, ""Put it in my a**!"" Unless you're a teenager who will laugh at all things scatological, you might want to consider putting a bullet in your own rear end for finding an outrageously stupid gag like that funny. My God! How screenwriters actually get paid to write this crap still boggles my mind! A man of Cedric's talent is capable of doing much, much more, as he's shown in the ""Barbershop"" movies. But when given rotten material like this, he attempts to mend each failed joke with improvisation, which in turn makes the jokes even more annoying.",0,"[cedric, entertainer, certainly, talented, comedian, script, boring, stupid, even, could, breathe, life, horrible, mess, comedy, despite, bad, review, still, slightly, eager, check, movie, year, start, already, candidate, bad, movie, spy, comedy, do, death, fact, writer, nothing, new, bring, table, help, must, chuckle, total, time, receive, laugh, whatsoever, movie, thankfully, approach, conclusion, jokingly, thought, probably, one, flick, contains, gag, reel, closing, credit, well, right, frequently, disapprove, gag, reel, credit, good, movie, show, gag, reel, bad, movie, like, rub, salt, wound, part, movie, worth, check, nicolette, sheridan, erotic, dance, lingerie, movie, ever, make, hbo, demand, suggest, particular, scene, mute, sound, watch, loop, ...]","[cedric, the entertainer, is, certainly, a talented comedian, with, script, boring and stupid, even, he, could not breathe, life, into, this horrible mess, of, a comedy, despite, the bad reviews, i, was, still slightly eager, to, check, the, movie, the year, has just started, already i, have, a candidate, for, the worst movies, of, the spy comedy, has been done, to, death, the fact, that, the writers, had, nothing, new, to, bring, to, the table, did not help, i, must have chuckled, a total, of, 5 times, received, laughs, whatsoever, as, the movie, thankfully, approached, its conclusion, i, jokingly thought, to, myself, is, probably, of, those flicks, contains, a gag reel, over, closing, credits, was right, i, frequently disapprove, of, gag reels, over, the credits, of, good movies, when, you, show, a gag reel, after, a bad movie, it, is, like, rubbing, salt, on, a wound, the only part, of, this movie, worth checking, ...]",0.09830862384466818,-0.009086494257850276,0,2,2
Company (2002) - IMDb, Wow!,moviebuff8117,April/2002,9/10,"Ram Gopal Varma's latest offering 'Company' is probably one of the best Indian gangster films ever made (after Nayakan and Satya). This film is so well done that the viewers feel like they are watching real-life events. And people living in India will know that some of the events are actually inspired by real-life incidents, although the film does not admit it.
Company is the story of two friends - Malik (Ajay Devgan) and Chandu (Vivek Oberoi) - how they build up the 'Company' - Bombay underworld on a global scale and thus establish their supremacy. A small misunderstanding between them turns into a large scale mafia war. The cast in this film is great, a special mention must be made of Vivek Oberoi. The son of Suresh Oberoi (former Bollywood star) is talented and seems to have put in a lot of effort for his first film. I only hope he doesn't get type-casted in the future after such a hard-hitting role on debut. Ajay Devgan fits very well into the role of Malik, a cold blooded don who always means business. Manisha Koirala enacts the role of Malik's girlfriend pretty well and is refreshing. However, the biggest surprise of this film was Antara Mali. She has done a great job as Chandu's wife, and it only goes to show that there is no dearth of talent in the country.The narrative is well paced, and the viewer never gets bored. Some people might find the absence of songs in the film annoying, but their presence would only hamper the pace of the film. The script is well written, and some of the dialogues are really memorable - for example, when Malik says ""To forgive a friend's mistake is an even bigger mistake in the 'Company'"". The background music by Sandeep Chowta really complements the plot and he certainly deserves some credit. But more than anything, it is Ram Gopal Varma's direction that needs to be appreciated. He has proved once again that with a good story, an excellent cast and a lot of determination, one can make a memorable film and defy some of Bollywood's age old norms. A special mention must also be made of Mohanlal. He is certainly one of the best Indian actors of all time and although his Hindi dialogue-delivery in Company is quite sloppy, he deserves a lot of praise for making a good effort. His portrayal of an honest, determined cop trying to eradicate crime in Bombay (loosely based on Sivanandan, Joint Commissioner of Police, Mumbai) is very well executed.The film gives us an in-depth view into the dark world of Bombay Mafia, where only the fittest survive, and how their operations have spread on a global scale. One thing I found intriguing about this film was the role that mobile phones play, how everything can be controlled efficiently by just making one phone call, and how business deals and murders can be executed with, quite literally, just one push of a button.Bottomline:  This film is a must-watch.

Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) - IMDb," an extended jam on an established theme, with improvisations",angelynx-23,July/2002,9/10,"I'll try to avoid echoing other comments here and cut straight to the chase: This is not perfect, but MAN it's so close. I had some trouble with the pacing, which seemed a bit slow to me--as if they weren't quite sure how to work with a feature-length timeframe; I'm still a bit hazy on just how the villain's threat was resolved, which I'm usually not after a CB episode; and gosh, *why* isn't ""Tank!"" on the soundtrack?  Songs with words just don't cut it in a CB score. --But honestly, those seem like such small problems next to everything that's wonderful about this movie. It has all the stuff you love about Bebop the series: the brilliant, flashing action and fight sequences, the character interaction, Spike's nicotine jones =), the gorgeous cinematic visuals, and the dreamlike melancholy that underlies even the funniest moments.  The villain, his grip on the fantasy/reality divide completely erased after a genetic experiment on Titan, makes a neat counterpoint to Spike, forever haunted by his dreams of the perfect future he once believed in. Jet's protective concern for his reckless teammates was never better painted than in a scene where he blusters about how much happier he was without any of them and couldn't care less where they are, only to pounce on the phone's first ring like a worried mom on date night. There's just a *little* more of Faye's skin for the fanboys (but only a very little bit more, honest! we're not talking topless here! x my heart!), Ed has a trick-or-treat encounter that would never make it to American TV,  and even the Big Shot duo put in an appearance (despite having absolutely nothing to say).

Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) - IMDb, I expected more.,lewiskendell7,July/2010,5/10,"""Well, that's a real shame. But, we're not cops and we're not from some charity organization. Sorry lady, we don't protect or serve. This is strictly business.""One word came to my mind after watching this. Unnecessary.I have been putting off watching the Cowboy Bebop movie for several years now. I'm a huge fan of the show, but I had heard and read so many mixed or negative reviews of the movie online and from friends, that I was hesitant to see it. In the end, though, I figured that any Cowboy Bebop had to be somewhat worthwhile. That turned out to be partially true, but I still find myself disappointed.To be blunt, the story was completely uninteresting. Each episode of the series was like a (good) mini-movie on its own, so I don't get why giving the creators more time to develop and tell this story, ended up producing something that wasn't nearly as engaging as any given one of the original episodes. It felt like the decision to make the movie came first, and very little effort was put into making a worthy plot to go along with it.The new characters are uniformly dull, much of the soundtrack was poor (How did THAT happen? Where's the jazz?), and the film as a whole felt disjointed, at best. I tried as hard as o could to like it all, but the most positive description I can give for my experience is ""meh"".I'll admit that it warmed my fanboy heart to see Spike, Faye, and the gang in action again. The animation was very good, and some of the action scenes were top notch. But without the great storytelling that we've all come to expect, I'd recommend this to only the most fervent Cowboy Bebop fan. You'd have much more fun in the same amount of time by just watching four of your favorite episodes of the show. ",0,"[well, real, shame, cop, charity, organization, sorry, lady, protect, serve, strictly, business, one, word, come, mind, watch, put, watch, cowboy, bebop, movie, several, year, huge, fan, show, heard, read, many, mixed, negative, review, movie, online, friend, hesitant, see, end, though, figure, cowboy, bebop, somewhat, worthwhile, turn, partially, true, still, find, blunt, story, completely, uninteresting, episode, series, like, good, get, give, creator, time, develop, tell, story, end, produce, something, nearly, engage, give, one, original, episode, felt, like, decision, make, movie, come, first, little, effort, put, make, worthy, plot, go, along, new, character, uniformly, dull, much, soundtrack, poor, happen, jazz, film, whole, ...]","[well, is, a real shame, we, are, not cops, we, are, not, from, some charity organization, sorry lady, we, do not protect, serve, is, strictly, business.""one word, came, to, my mind, after, watching, have been putting, off, watching, the cowboy bebop movie, for, several years, now, i, am, a huge fan, of, the show, i, had heard, read so many mixed, negative reviews, of, the movie, online, from, friends, that, i, was, hesitant, to, see, it, in, the end, though, i, figured, that, any cowboy bebop, had, to, be, somewhat worthwhile, turned out, to, be, partially true, i, still find, myself, disappointed.to, be, blunt, the story, was, completely uninteresting, each episode, of, the series, was, like, good, mini-movie, on, its, own, so i, do not get, why, giving, the creators, more time, to, develop, tell, this story, ended, up, producing, something, was not nearly as engaging, ...]",0.01837008970991652,0.03265221407166235,0,0,1
DOA: Dead or Alive (2006) - IMDb, Good fun if you're in the right mood!,supertom-319,September/2006,7/10,"Dead or Alive is a film that is so exploitative and atrociously bad, that somehow it ended up being a whole lot of fun. However to view this as a fun film, it must be viewed as intended: With brain switched off, and ol' Mr McDong taking control of your functions for 80 minutes. Yes, this may be a film with a predominantly female cast, but ladies need not turn up to watch this, cause they probably won't enjoy it, unless their sexual barometer is registering the opposite end from ""hetero."" This film is total gratuity in every regard, from the scantily clad, sexy ladies, to the barrage of testosterone pumping action. This is hot chicks doing high kicks! So with that, and having this the pre-conceived idea when I bought my ticket, I knew I'd enjoy it. Hell the film was marketed right. It's about a video game and has the subtlety of said game, which is in the button bashing, short attention span of the games spectrum. It's a simple movie for a simple movie going experience. IF anyone goes into this film and comes out having not enjoyed it, then they SHOULD have known better! I think only those who want to see this kind of film, who are in the mood, will watch, and they'll get a kick out of it like me. Critics will despise it cause it represents a film they have to watch, but probably don't want to.So DOA is essentially a non-interactive video game, an FMV if you will. It's got an awful script, mediocre acting, and all the efforts of the filmmakers have gone into perfectly capturing, glistening, bouncing boobies amongst the martial arts mayhem. The plot essentially is nothing more than little set-ups to all the fights, taking place at a secret fighting tournament set up by Eric Roberts, in grade-A scenery chewing mode. Roberts to me is a tragic waste of talent, who in the early 80's looked a great prospect and to some, me included, has more talent than his over-rated sister Julia (who now of course takes all the plaudits). Roberts is consigned to doing DTV movies now, or TV movies and on the rare occasion he appears back in the multiplexes, it's in another B-movie that usually is awful. However at least Eric is enjoying himself here, relishing his return (somewhat) to the limelight. or to put it another way, to remind people Julia wasn't an only child! The rest of the main cast, who register any interest, are the hot ladies. There's the rather bizarre, yet strikingly attractive looking Devon Aoki and then there's also Holly Valance, Sarah Carter and Natassia Malthe too. However it's Jaime Pressley who steals the show, not only with her performance, that delivers the most laughs (intentional ones that is), but also she has a bod to die for and considering some stiff competition from Valances sculpted physique in particular, that's no mean feat.Overall though this film will go down as a classic bad movie. The filmmakers never intended making anything beyond what they deliver. This is bad, it's cheesy and it's forgettable. But it's outrageously fun while it lasts and it most certainly requires the wearing of loose fitting underwear to allow for Sgt Schlong to stand to attention every now and again. I feel guilty having enjoyed it, but I had a good idea of the film that would be delivered and it was delivered as I imagined. ***",1,"[dead, alive, film, exploitative, atrociously, bad, somehow, end, whole, lot, fun, however, view, fun, film, must, view, intend, brain, switch, ol, mr, mcdong, take, control, function, minute, yes, may, film, predominantly, female, cast, lady, need, turn, watch, probably, enjoy, unless, sexual, barometer, register, opposite, end, hetero, film, total, gratuity, every, regard, scantily, clad, sexy, lady, barrage, testosterone, pump, action, hot, chick, high, kick, idea, bought, ticket, knew, would, enjoy, hell, film, market, right, video, game, subtlety, say, game, button, bashing, short, attention, span, game, spectrum, simple, movie, simple, movie, go, experience, anyone, go, film, come, enjoy, know, better, think, want, ...]","[dead, alive, is, a film, is, so exploitative and atrociously bad, that, somehow, it, ended, up, being, a whole lot, of, fun, however, to, view, this as, a fun film, it, must be viewed, as, intended, with, brain, switched, off, ol, mr mcdong, taking, control, of, your functions, for, 80 minutes, may be, a film, with, a predominantly female cast, ladies, need not turn up, to, watch, because, they, probably will not enjoy, it, unless, their sexual barometer, is registering, the opposite end, from, hetero, this film, is, total gratuity, in, every regard, from, scantily clad, sexy ladies, to, the barrage, of, testosterone, pumping, action, is, hot chicks, doing, high kicks, so, with that, having, this the pre-conceived idea, when, i, bought, my ticket, i, knew, i, would enjoy, it, hell, the film, was marketed, right, it, is, about, a video game, has, the subtlety, said, game, is, in, the button, ...]",-0.02036803448954417,0.14258297972987694,1,1,3

There's no sense of suspense, interesting characters or successful attempts at intentional humour- just over edited fights mixed with a healthy portion of T&A.Will the fans like it ?

Dance Flick (2009) - IMDb," Dance Flick did not ""step up"" like it should have",Smells_Like_Cheese22,May/2009,2/10,"With the recent disappointments that have been in the spoof movie genre, we needed something fresh and funny, well we're not getting that obviously. But ever since the Friedberg/Seltzer team has joined in the ""I can make a movie too"" bandwagon, we were begging the Waynes Brothers to come back. The last really funny spoof movies are the Scary Movie series, they were clever and in our faces about the clichés in horror movies. The past few years we have had a major thing with dance movies like: Save the Last Dance, Step Up, Stomp the Yard, You Got Served, Honey, etc. Leave it to the Wayanes Brothers to finally put this genre in it's over clichéd and overused scripts in it's place. Unfortunately Dance Flick did not meet my expectations, it was one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. I can't even believe how many problems there was with this movie, wither it's the editing, acting, or direction, Dance Flick is a let down.Megan is a former dancer who goes to a new school where everyone can magically sing and dance. She meets some new friends like Tracy, Charity and Thomas who is in a street dance gang. When Thomas and Megan connect they must face their ""impossible"" dreams together. Trying to ""bring it"", they work together to bring the ultimate dance group together. They also must face the difficulty of having a inter-racial relationship, as black women and white men passing them by, they try to pretend their love isn't real. But will they put all aside to help Thomas and his crew win the five grand to pay back his sponsor? Well, if you've see the ""dance flicks"" of the past decade, you know how it goes.Now for some odd reason I did get a few laughs out of a stupid movie like Meet the Spartans, but that was because I kept my expectations low and knew what I was going into. With Dance Flick it was completely different, I was really excited because we have a really funny team working on the film. But they relied too much on the gross jokes, instead of getting a laugh from them, they keep pushing on the gross jokes too much on the audience and it just didn't work. The actors seemed to force their comedy too much as well where they were just not funny. The movie was also, like most spoof movies, was way too short as well, the stories didn't make sense and were just too random. I'm sorry to say that Dance Flick is just a bad movie, it has a couple giggles here and there, but the audience was silent throughout most of the film. I'd say to skip the movie, if you really want to see it, go for the rental.2/10",0,"[recent, disappointment, spoof, movie, genre, need, something, fresh, funny, well, get, obviously, ever, since, team, join, make, movie, bandwagon, beg, wayne, brother, come, back, last, really, funny, spoof, movie, scary, movie, series, clever, face, clichés, horror, movie, past, year, major, thing, dance, movie, like, save, last, dance, step, stomp, yard, get, serve, honey, etc, leave, wayanes, brother, finally, put, genre, clichéd, overuse, script, place, unfortunately, dance, flick, meet, expectation, one, movie, use, funny, clip, trailer, even, believe, many, problem, movie, wither, edit, act, direction, dance, flick, let, former, dancer, go, new, school, everyone, magically, sing, dance, meet, new, friend, like, ...]","[with, the recent disappointments, have been, in, the spoof movie genre, we, needed, something, fresh and funny, well, we, are not getting, that, obviously, ever, since, the friedberg/seltzer team, has joined, in, i, can make, a movie, too, bandwagon, we, were begging, the waynes brothers, to, come, back, the last really funny spoof movies, are, the scary movie series, they, were, clever, in, our faces, about, the clichés, in, horror movies, the past few years we, have had, a major thing, with, dance movies, like, save, the last dance, step, up, stomp, the yard, you, got served, honey, leave, it, to, the wayanes brothers, to, finally put, this genre, in, it, is, over, clichéd, overused, scripts, in, it, is place, unfortunately dance flick, did not meet, my expectations, it, was, of, those movies, that, used, all the funny clips, in, the trailer, i, cannot even believe, how, many problems, there was, with, this movie, wither, it, is, the editing, acting, direction, dance flick, ...]",0.12459550888152489,0.032255307754258083,0,2,2

Great!,hilaryswank20115,October/2017,10/10,"Mahavir Singh Phogat teaches his two daughters to be international wrestling players of India! This is a simple and impressive story. And they finally defeat UK on the wrestling match. 
I think this is India's 'Yip Man'! This kind of nationalism is healthy and is beneficial to all audiences without background considerations. The film length is also accurate. Growing courses of protagonists need 160 minutes. And emotional responses to their tragic mistakes are well described by the talented actors in detail. Audiences can fully engage in this film. 
A lot of Asian audiences have bias against Indian films that their films are just dances and songs for two hours or more, however there is the perfect construction of story with minimalist use of songs and musics. 
This quality is higher than any Japanese films of today! Indian filmmakers should keep this high quality of film content! It is competitive to Hollywood films. At the end of the film, it is full of enlightenment, the most important thing in life is not 'thing' but it is a human relationship with emotion. If you are true to your families' goodness and emotion, you'll find the best solution of your problem. Even though you fail in this way, your family relationship will only be enhanced as the result of your effort and sincereness. This what this film tells you!

Deadpool (2016) - IMDb," Highly over-praised. Not a complete trash, but barely okay.",NpMoviez12,June/2018,6/10,"""Deadpool"" is a very fun movie. After the characterization of Deadpool I saw in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", I never wanted a Deadpool movie. I got one. It didn't disappoint. But at the same time I feel it is one of the most over-praised movies of all times. I don't hate this movie at all, but at the same time, I don't like it either. The majority of it is entertaining. What works? First and foremost, the character - Deadpool. This hilarious and goofy badass merc with a mouth is something I really liked. His jokes, punchlines and fourthwall breaking humor lands perfectly. Secondly, the non linear storytelling. If this movie had a linear storytelling, it wouldn't have been half as entertaining as it is. Thirdly, the hilarious character moments and slapstick comedy. The character interaction between Deadpool and some of the ""X-Men"", and Francis, and Dopinder, and Negasonic are funny and entertaining - sometimes involving some slapsticky things which are grose and graphic but solely due to Deadpool's mutation, makes it funny. The fourth wall break - take this element out, the movie is totally incomplete. Action scenes - pretty good, especially the first one. But that's all I liked about it. What bothered? A lot of things. It takes too much of liberty, due to the fourth wall breaking elements it has. It uses a number of movie clichés of the superhero genre and mock them by breaking the fourth wall. That surely is hilarious, but doesn't change the fact that the movie had a lazy writing. Also the plot is a typical superhero origins stuff, a little more romantic, though. None of the plotlines were exciting or intriguing. It felt good just because of the way the character Deadpool was written. Else, every one of them were simply clichéd materials. It felt as if we had to accept whatever was shoved down our throats and we had all the fourth wall breaks to cover it up. That felt like an overconfidence in the part of the makers. Also, one particular scene involving Deadpool and the villain feels too stretched. If it wasn't there, we won't have a third act. Why are people intentionally looking over these? I am completely surprised to see a bunch of people saying this is the greatest superhero film ever. It isn't bad, and doesn't suck. That's all. I can name a whole lot of superhero movies much better than this - ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Spider-Man"" (2002), "" Spider-Man 2"" (2004), ""Logan"" (2017), ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), ""Deadpool 2"" (2018), ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011), ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), ""X-Men"" (2000), ""Batman Begins"" (2005), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), ""Unbreakable"" (2000), ""The Avengers"" (2012), ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003), ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), etc. So, I absolutely don't feel that it being called ""the greatest superhero film"" is apt. In the end, it is essential to say that Ryan Reynolds is absolutely great as Wade Wilson/Deadpool.

Deadpool (2016) - IMDb, Boring and Pointless,bsingh_p22,February/2016,1/10,"One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. ""superheroes"", ""superslaves"" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of ""F"" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent.

Die Hard (1988) - IMDb, The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time,ivo-cobra84,February/2018,10/10,"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back.

District 9 (2009) - IMDb, The first science fiction masterpiece in years,NonSequiturL13,August/2009,10/10,"I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".District 9 has so much to like.

District 9 (2009) - IMDb, Very disappointed by both the movie and the other reviewers.,batatas3118,August/2009,1/10,"I am appalled that so many people love this film, with many claiming it to be a masterpiece. It was the rave reviews and the high ratings that influenced my decision to watch this film, but now that I have seen it, I honestly do not see what all the buzz is about. This movie failed to deliver on almost every end. The characters were flat, the filming style was annoying, and the plot was unbelievable with too many holes. SpoilersWhile the action isn't great either, the main problem with the film is that it makes an obvious attempt to appeal to the empathy of the audience and horrible fails at it because of absurdity. The success of this movie relies on whether or not the audience actually cares about the main character, Wikus, but there is no character development. The so called bond between the alien wearing the red clothes and Wikus, is laughable. The movie barely shows them together throughout the film, but for some unapparent reason, we're expected to accept that by the end of the movie they've developed a close bond out of thin air. A bond that they are willing to risk their lives for. ""I won't leave you"", says the aliens, ""I'll come back...I promise"". Huh?... What a load of ridiculous crap. Was I supposed to shed a tear at that moment. For those of you who actually felt emotional at that moment, I worry for you. I mean, Wikus was not even a likable guy. The whole time he acted like an asshole and he had an utterly annoying accent. Did the director of this movie expect us to actually care about the guy. I sure as hell didn't. He was a selfish bastard throughout the whole movie, who only cared about himself. The only reason I could come up with for why he protected the alien at the end was that it was his only chance of becoming human again. I can honestly say that I think that he got what he deserved. The story also contains too many flaws. Gaping flaws that make this movie nearly unwatchable. For this part I'll just ask all the questions that I have. I mean, how is it possible that the aliens got stranded on Earth in the first place and then after 20 some years, the mothership seems to magically work again? Why does alien fuel turn a guy into an alien? Why would the aliens have an antidote for a guy turning into an alien? Why would Wikus only cut off a finger? Why didn't the aliens retaliate with their superior technology? Why would the government allow the aliens to be so loosely controlled? Why do the aliens act like savages even though they are supposed to be an advanced race? Why can't the aliens contact their planet, wouldn't they have the technology? Why are humans allowed to stay in District 9? Why would Wikus's wife actual believe that he performed some sort of sexual activity with an alien? Why is a spaceship buried under ground? Am I missing something? Yes, I am being a bit too critical, but it's just because people keep saying that this movie is so so great and it bothers me. I have much more to say, but I'll just leave it at this.

Double Team (1997) - IMDb," Good action, but with some big plot-holes.",action-619,March/1999,7/10,"Double Team is the third movie that Van Damme has done for a former HONG-KONG action-movie director. He has done ""Hard Target"" for John Woo and ""Maximum Risk"" for Ringo Lam.  Double Team is directed by rather splendid Tsui Hark.  Hark is excellent at directing action-scenes and Double Team is a good way for him to start in Hollywood. Van Damme plays agent Jack Quinn, and is sent out to kill super-terrorist Stavros, who is played by Mickey Rourke.  Quinn fails and is therefore sent sent to a place called ""The Colony"".  ""The Colony"" is a place where the world's most dangerous terrorists/agents are sent. These agents/terrorists are too dangerous to go free on the street and too valuable to kill.  Quinn escapes from the colony and goes after Stavroes for revenge.  Quinn is helped by Yaz, who is played by the basket-star Dennis Rodmann.  Double Team is full of well made action and martial-art scenes. However, it`s far from perfect.

Double Team (1997) - IMDb, Van Damme v. a Tiger!,AwesomeWolf1,June/2005,5/10,"Continuing the tradition of successful Hong Kong directors going to Hollywood only to end up directing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies comes Tsui Hark with 'Double Team'. John Woo must have gotten lucky when he went to Hollywood: Ringo Lam is still making Van Damme movies, and Tsui Hark went back to Hong Kong after this and 'Knock Off'. I have nothing against Van Damme, but he seems to be some sort of trial-by-fire for any Hong Kong director with ambitions of making action films in Hollywood: If a director succeeds, he go on to Dolph Lundgren and then mainstream Hollywood action (John Woo), otherwise the director is faced with sticking with Van Damme movies or going back to Hong Kong.Counter-terrorist Jack Quinn (Van Damme) is planning to retire after one final mission to nail the villainous Stavros (Mickey Rourke). The mission goes incredibly wrong: Stravos gets away, but somehow his son is killed in the cross-fire. Out for revenge, Stavros kidnaps the pregnant Kathryn Quinn (Natacha Lindinger), and the only way Jack can save is wife is team up with Yaz (Dennis Rodman) and kick-box his way to a happy ending.Watching 'Double Team', I thought it was pretty clear than even Van Damme realizes that his movies are a joke to all but the most hardcore of action fans. Australian sketch comedy show 'Full Frontal' (featuring a not-so-famous Eric Bana) regularly took stabs at Van Damme for a good year or so (""YOU LAUGHTER CRACKIN' AT ME? ARRRGGGHHHHH!""), coincidentally around when 'Double Team' would have been released. At no point does 'Double Team' make any attempt to be taken as a serious action movie. All the fight scenes are played for laughs, if only slight chuckles. Van Damme gets to fight a tiger and use a coke-machine to shield himself from an explosion. All it really amounts to be is 90 minutes of action fun.While fans of director Tsui Hark would be disappointed with this effort, something good came of Hark's short-lived collaborations with Van Damme: He went back to Hong Kong and directed the incredibly awesome 'Time and Tide' (which did not feature Jean-Claude Van Damme at all).'Double Team' doesn't come to close to being one of Van Damme's best, and it might not even please hard-core Van Damme fans, but its all in good fun - 5/10",0,"[continue, tradition, successful, hong, kong, director, go, hollywood, end, direct, van, damme, movie, come, tsui, hark, wouldouble, team, john, woo, must, gotten, lucky, go, hollywood, ringo, lam, still, make, van, damme, movie, tsui, hark, go, back, hong, kong, nothing, van, damme, seems, sort, hong, kong, director, ambition, make, action, film, hollywood, director, succeeds, go, dolph, lundgren, mainstream, hollywood, action, john, woo, otherwise, director, face, stick, van, damme, movie, go, back, hong, jack, quinn, van, damme, planning, retire, one, final, mission, nail, villainous, stavros, mickey, rourke, mission, go, incredibly, wrong, stravos, get, away, somehow, son, kill, revenge, stavros, kidnaps, pregnant, kathryn, ...]","[continuing, the tradition, of, successful hong kong directors, going, to, hollywood, only, to, end, up, directing, jean-claude van, damme, movies, comes, tsui, hark, with, wouldouble team, john woo, must have gotten, lucky, when, he, went, to, hollywood, ringo lam, is still making, van, damme, movies, tsui, hark went, back, to, hong kong, after, knock, off, i, have nothing against, van, damme, he, seems, to, be, some sort, of, trial-by-fire, for, any hong kong director, with, ambitions, of, making, action films, in, hollywood, if, a director, succeeds, he, go, on to, dolph lundgren, then mainstream hollywood action, john woo, otherwise, the director, is faced, with, sticking, with, van damme movies, going, back, to, hong, kong.counter-terrorist jack quinn, van, damme, is planning, to, retire, after, one final mission, to, nail, the villainous stavros, mickey rourke, the mission, goes, incredibly wrong, stravos, gets, away, somehow, ...]",0.01002549274680037,-0.08721987153019062,0,0,0

Driven (2001) - IMDb," Not necessarily an arthouse masterpiece, yet nowhere as bad as its rep.",moonlightreflections16,May/2001,8/10,"It's been often mentioned by other reviewers that the art of the cornball must have been engineered by Sylvester Stallone;  it's just as often forgotten that true tripe goes unwatched merely because it does not go into wide, national release.  So guess which movies always receive the worse rep?Having watched the trailer and anticipated this movie for a while, I knew exactly what to expect beforehand: your typical good guy vs. bad guy, fight for glory, 'win-all-lose-all final confrontation' fare.  Surprisingly, I encountered something that attempted to be a little more profound, and while it doesn't exactly hint at the meaning of existence, it explores a facet of human relationships which not many other movies in this genre have touched. The movie's tagline, ""Welcome to the human race,"" does a nice job of encompassing all that this film discusses.The peculiar thing about the entire setup is that, unlike all other movies in this genre, there are no defined lines.  There is no good guy, no bad guy;  simply a race for perfection that alludes to the way that most of us wish to live, though the path that we take is an altogether different matter.  It's difficult to pick up on, but if enough attention is paid, the idiosyncrasies of each of the characters in this movie speak far more than what their dialogue brings to the table.Where the film falters, and causes most of the audience to misperceive its message, is in its presentation.  It's frenetic, loud, and highly distracting;  and yet, tremendously appealing to this particular viewer. The speed with which the director cuts between shots, pans, zooms, spins, spirals, etc., go hand in hand with the feel of the sport in general, and is indeed very creative -- but it is hard to keep up with what's going on.  How are we supposed to know what each character is feeling when the scene cuts away before the dialogue is even finished?  How are we supposed to be even able to recognize what's happening on the screen when we're not given more than a two-second break between blaringly obtrusive rock songs?  Once again, the movie alludes to the sport itself with the commercialization of its soundtrack.  And while highly kinetic, and emotionally involving at times (the opening scene with the media was brilliantly executed for a Jimmy Bly point of view), it's just hard to...keep track of everything.But in the end, the main reason anybody is going to watch this movie for is the racing, particularly the accidents that take place at excesses of 200 miles per hour.  And it delivers pretty admirably, truth be told.  There are a lot of interesting camera positions and perspectives to make you feel a part of the race, and the special effects could be considered top-notch. Kudos to whoever decided to not give the CG cars and items the cheap, laughter-inducing fluidity of movement that's to be found in just about any other movie with computer graphics (though there were a few scenes with this effect).  It's not necessarily realistic, and a little simplistic on the artistic scale, but it reaches a satisfying level of subtlety--and at times, it's fascinating to see some of the things that can be done.The film is not without its clichés, it sometimes forgets about or fails to discuss a few of its plot points, and the women appear to be portrayed a little 2-dimensionally.  But when the crew is watching the race or practice runs from the movie's dramatic camera angles on their small overhead monitor, you simply don't care.  The movie takes itself seriously, but it's also intended to be fun;  it's merely up to the viewer to interpret how they wish to take it.  The first time, it may be a little difficult to swallow, but with subsequent bites, you begin to grow accustomed and appreciate its distinct flavor.Here's hoping that Stallone sticks to it for a while longer.

Driven (2001) - IMDb," Man, I wanted this movie to be good...",senninha7026,July/2002,1/10,"As a big auto racing fan, CART in particular, I awaited this movie since the mid-90's when it was discussed as a Formula One movie.  However, Formula One wouldn't allow the access that it did for Grand Prix in 1966, so the director defaulted to the North American CART series.  CART allowed unprecedented access to its venues, races, paddock, announcers, drivers, sponsors, etc.  But this movie fails in that it is nothing more than an auto racing cliché.  As a fan, it's hard to rebuff the blood sport aspect of the sport to those who are not fans.  The crashes are incredibly unrealistic, some of the tracks are non-existent and the drivers are paper thin.  The scene near the swimming pool with the blonde vixen doing some sort of goofy water aerobics is pathetic.  The part where Jimmy Bly steals a car (that happens to be filled with fuel indoors and doesn't need an external starter to run) and drives it through the Chicago streets with Stalone in tow is just ridiculous.  And to they get arrested or even prosecuted for this action?  No, they just are forced to convey one of the stupidest dialogues in the history of racing movies.The CART series is in serious trouble in real life.  A movie about the excitement of the series, the strategy, the action and the pageantry of racing could have boosted the series back to national respectability.

Dungeons & Dragons (2000) - IMDb, Just shoot me...,gaussgoat5,February/2001,1/10,"In what can only be described as the worst movie made in the past decade, Dungeons & Dragons will leave you begging for mercy.Hands down, the biggest contributor to the demise of this movie was the script.  It was litterally the most insulting, inane dialogue I have ever been treated to in a movie.Props arrive next in an extremely close second.  The 35 Million dollars used to make this film must have been used on late night taco runs, because the quality of the props is abyssmal.  The ""prized artifact"" of the movie looks like it fell out of a box of cracker jack, while some of the armor and backgrounds are straight out of the Bargain Bin at your local toy store. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.The acting was terrible all around.  The few, and I mean FEW, attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by the worst script ever.  The only remotely cool character in the entire proceeding was Demadar, who was still pretty goofy.  I guess if I was 8 or so, I might have thought he was creepy.

Dunkirk (2017) - IMDb," A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters""",nimdude22,July/2017,10/10,"Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10",1,"[dunkirk, opinion, yet, another, masterpiece, mastermind, christopher, nolan, since, everything, brilliant, film, already, say, briefly, write, think, film, also, touch, topic, people, criticize, movie, fantastically, direct, film, told, perspective, non, chronologically, superbly, tackle, narrative, non, linear, story, pull, away, intensity, event, happen, screen, stop, last, scene, han, zimmer, likely, give, one, fitting, score, war, film, ever, sometimes, one, note, play, follow, heartbeat, sound, tick, clock, time, massive, orchestra, interpret, go, screen, movie, brilliantly, project, feel, every, soldier, beach, audience, confusion, turmoil, fear, cinematography, breathtaking, felt, anxious, throughout, run, time, lead, film, really, say, anyone, stuck, give, brilliant, performance, need, explain, ...]","[dunkirk, is, in, my opinion, yet, another masterpiece, from, mastermind christopher nolan, since, everything, is, brilliant, about, the film, has already been said, i, will briefly, write, i, think, of, the film, also touch, on, a topic, that, some people, are criticizing, the movie, for.the, fantastically directed, film, is told, from, 3 perspectives, chronologically, it, superbly tackles, the narrative, linear story, does not at, all pull you, away, from, the intensity, of, the events, happening, on, screen, do not stop, from, to, the last scene, hans, zimmer, most, likely, gives, of, the most fitting scores, for, a war film, ever, sometimes, is, only, one note, playing followed, by, heartbeat, sounds, a ticking clock, while, other, times, a massive orchestra, is interpreting, is going, on on, screen, the movie, brilliantly, projects, the feeling, of, each and every soldier, on, the beach, to, the audience, confusion, turmoil and fear, the cinematography, was, breathtaking and i, felt, anxious, throughout, most of, ...]",-0.1261765890783033,0.013825251970624331,1,1,1
Dunkirk (2017) - IMDb, Did I see a different movie than everyone else that has raved about how good it is?,PanheadAndy26,July/2017,5/10,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes.

That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket.

Characters develop new relationships and interact differently from the show. The three EVA pilots from the original series get some great development here and differ a lot from NGE in a very good way. New characters are introduced, stakes are raised and the film has a lot of build up which boils down to one hell of a climax.The film has a more intense tone this time around and is very fast paced. The action is incredibly engaging and the film is the first in a while that has gotten my heart beating like crazy during the intense action on-screen. The film does give you breathing space with lighthearted interactions between characters and humor and thus makes it less heavy overall than NGE and EOE even though it certainly is more gruesome and still has it's moments of pure nightmare fuel.The Score of Evangelion is at it's best in this film and truly delivers. It varies from beautifully orchestrated racing score to sweet and engaging J-pop and Anno sure makes the out-of-place songs fit as well as he did in the show and EOE. The entire experience watching this addition to the series is unforgettable and gives me much hope for even more improvement in the next two installments.Overall the film is a vast improvement for the series and hints at better things to come with it's significant changes and has raised the stakes for the Evangelion universe.

I look at the Shinji in this movie and yes, he does seem a bit shy and... but wait! there's a big action sequence coming up! Damn does the new angel design look cool! Oh yes, where were we? The characters... well in the original series there was that totally weird blue haired girl the likes of which we'd never seen in another anime before. Rei was such an enigma, you had to guess if she was even human or not. Thankfully this is fixed now and yes, she is a bit strange... but wait! Big action sequence coming through! 10 minutes of gorgeous explosions and punches! Yay, this is amazing!! So back to Rei.. now she is cooking for a party. Isn't this lovely, that's more how a young girl should behave. Not like that Asuka who is now in an aggressive mood. Always. In the original show she used to be a lot more likable, maybe because we could see a more childish side of her. Now she's this annoying genius who feels lonely and... But wait another super-cool fight is starting after this 38th panty shot! Wow it's our new character! She's great and she's... umm...she's like...well... i don't really know, but she kicks ass!!

Fantastic Four (2015) - IMDb," I liked it, but I can see why others didn't",equazcion3,October/2015,8/10,"Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave it a shot anyway.I'd like to borrow a quote from another reviewer here that expresses quite accurately why this movie didn't do well (even though the review was intended to be negative):""Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.""That about sums it up. Superhero audiences were expecting something similar to recent superhero offerings, and they didn't get it. For myself, being generally not terribly impressed with most recent superhero movies, I had a somewhat different reaction. There have been a couple standouts, like Batman Begins and Iron Man, but on the whole most seem like forgettable, disposable eye candy. If taken as a standalone flick, independent of any expectation, this is a decent movie.

Fantastic Four (2015) - IMDb, A pointless reboot which fails to improve on the original film in almost every manner possible,jimbo-53-18651123,June/2016,1/10,"Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans.The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film.A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect.I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way.The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here.The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up.All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",0,"[base, scientific, project, reed, richards, mile, teller, develop, transfer, matter, one, dimension, another, fantastic, four, use, guinea, pig, order, transfer, another, dimension, belief, something, worldly, dimension, benefit, planet, however, something, go, wrong, foursome, transportation, process, end, drastic, physical, transformation, much, noticeable, others, bad, still, try, fail, save, victor, von, doom, toby, kebbell, leave, behind, believe, dead, later, team, go, back, dimension, discover, victor, still, alive, bring, back, earth, order, ass, condition, victor, intention, stay, earth, determine, create, new, world, dimension, stop, nothing, achieve, objective, victor, also, suffer, physical, transformation, become, much, strong, powerful, former, friend, fantastic, four, find, must, work, ...]","[based, on, a scientific project, that, reed richards, miles, teller, has been developing, can transfer matter, from, one dimension, to, fantastic, four use themselves, as, guinea pigs, in, order, to, transfer, themselves, to, another dimension, in, the belief, that, is something, in, this other worldly dimension, will benefit, their own planet, however, something, goes, wrong, for, our foursome, during, the transportation process, they, end, up with, drastic physical transformations, are, much more noticeable, than, others, worse still, they, tried, failed, to, save, victor von doom, toby kebbell, leave, him, behind believing, him, to, be, dead, later, on, a team go, back, to, the other dimension, discover, that, victor, is, still alive, bring, him, back, to, earth, in, order, to, assess, his condition, victor, has, no intention, of, staying, on, earth, is determined, to, create, a new world, in, this other dimension, will stop, at, nothing, to, ...]",-0.21600489296828332,0.17497695425596516,1,1,3

He plays an agent who arrives in a coal mining town to put a stop to the toxic waste that is poisoning water. He makes a few friends as well as the expected enemies who wish not to be bothered. Boring concept followed by numerous fight scenes before concluding pretty much the same way. Director Felix Enriguez Acala is working with material that has about the same value as diarrhea. Even the production is boring. Seagal spends 90% of the film in combat where he beats up dozens of people including cops. I could only shake my head as some big lout threatens him and he beats the sh*t out him in short order as well as kicking around a bunch of his buddies. In lame supporting roles is Marg Helgenberger who clings to Seagal while he beats up her abusive brother. Harry Dean Stanton is far too valuable for this sh*t. Kris Kristofferson plays the standard villain in a role that is totally beneath him. Stephen Lang plays Helgenberger's nasty abusive brother who will end up with Seagal's foot up his ass.

For Love and Honour (2007) - IMDb, Disappointing apart from Sener Sen,ya19739,January/2008,4/10,"After some glorious reviews I was very curious to watch this movie. I must say I was quite disappointed all in all, but there were some positive elements as well: Sener Sen is fantastic in his performance, very convincing and his character truly shines. But that does not save the movie. I thought the main problem was an unfortunate mix of genres, which weakened the movie: it is supposed to be a drama, but there are (mainly unintended, almost ridiculous) ""slapstick""-like scenes or moments in it, that makes it like a caricature of itself. Of course drama and comedy can be very close but I am not talking about true comedy here. Slapstick elements in such a serious piece of work just simply ruins it. Since I felt like laughing in some of the supposedly most serious moments, the drama in it did not truly catch my full attention. The homosexual character was so exaggerated (like a persiflage), sympathetic but very calculated jokes, then Devran is still talking and saying odd stuff whilst he is almost about to die, generally people have very dramatic expressions in there faces once they are shot dead (this could be slapstick, truly!) or the girl's comment about Devrans ""best male piece"" not being as big as Murats, and Devrans reaction to it (slapstick pure!) and this unfortunate mixture just took so much away from the movie. I got distracted and even noticed some minor imperfections in editing or logic of scenes(which I normally don't tend to notice). For example, Ali Osman uses Murats mobile phone to call his friend and just presses one button (like a repeat call) but it is impossible that his friends number is saved in Murats phone as he does not even know him! Karaca is seriously injured by the shooting in the bar, she is in hospital etc and suddenly the injury seems to be gone, she is back to normal! All of this is a pity, as Sener Sen truly shines in his role, but alas this is not a solo performance.",0,"[glorious, review, curious, watch, movie, must, say, quite, disappoint, positive, element, well, sener, sen, fantastic, performance, convincing, character, truly, shine, save, movie, thought, main, problem, unfortunate, mix, genre, weaken, movie, suppose, drama, mainly, unintended, almost, ridiculous, slapstick, scene, moment, make, like, caricature, course, drama, comedy, close, talk, true, comedy, slapstick, element, serious, piece, work, simply, ruin, since, felt, like, laugh, supposedly, serious, moment, drama, truly, catch, full, attention, homosexual, character, exaggerated, like, persiflage, sympathetic, calculate, joke, devran, still, talk, say, odd, stuff, whilst, almost, die, generally, people, dramatic, expression, face, shot, dead, could, slapstick, truly, girl, comment, devrans, best, male, ...]","[after, some glorious reviews, i was, very curious, to, watch, this movie, i, must say i was quite disappointed, all in, were, some positive elements, as, well, sener sen, is, fantastic, in, his performance, very convincing, his character, truly shines, does not save, the movie, i, thought, the main problem, was, an unfortunate mix, of, genres, weakened, the movie, it, is supposed, to, be, a drama, are, mainly unintended, almost ridiculous, slapstick""-like scenes, moments, in, it, makes, it, like, a caricature, of, itself, of, course drama and comedy, can be very close, i, am not talking, about, true comedy, here, slapstick elements, in, such, a serious piece, of, work just simply ruins it, since, i, felt, like, laughing, in, some of, the supposedly most serious moments, the drama, in, it, did not truly catch, my full attention, the homosexual character, was so exaggerated, like, a persiflage, sympathetic, very calculated, jokes, then devran, is still talking, saying, odd stuff whilst he, is almost about, to, die, generally people, have, very dramatic expressions, in, faces, once, they, are, ...]",0.03699893089110237,-0.09815579541486365,0,0,0

Getaway (2013) - IMDb, I Don't Understand Why this Has Been So Poorly Received,kevrhon-12,September/2013,7/10,"I don't normally take the time to write reviews as I don't feel I have much to add to everyone else's take. But Getaway has been so poorly received, unjustifiably so in my opinion, that I thought I'd weigh in.This is a popcorn movie. Nothing more. I understood that going in. It's not high art. It doesn't revolutionize movie-making, and is not even the high point of the genre. But it's entertaining, and that's all I ask of a movie. Give me some popcorn and a Coke, and dim the lights, let me forget about the world for a couple hours, and I'm happy.The two leads are very good in my opinion. Ethan Hawke is a very capable actor, and he brought a depth to his character that I didn't expect. He expressed concern without being overly dramatic or gnashing his teeth or chewing up the scenery, and conveyed his character's limitations without appearing dumb. Selena Gomez was bright, and had the expected attitude of someone her character's age without being precocious or annoying.Most of the plot was admittedly easy to figure out early on, but the movie still provided plenty of excitement in how it got there. There were some aspects of the story that were dismissed without explaining a lot of detail, but it didn't rely on otherwise smart people doing dumb things to make it all work, and I appreciated that as well.I've read criticisms by others concerning the ""shaky-cam"" technique during the chase scenes. I didn't find that to be a problem in the least. It was much less annoying or even apparent than in movies like Transformers. I found everything was easy to follow and served the story well - I didn't think any style choices got in the way. And there was one street-level point of view sequence that I thought was especially well done - presumably a single take - that gave me a real rush.Overall, I enjoyed Getaway, but that may be in part because I went in with low expectations due to its opening weekend box office and some negative reviews. With stiff competition this summer there are certainly better choices for your entertainment dollar. I don't know if I'd even consider this in the top ten or twenty films this year.

Getaway (2013) - IMDb," Nothing but a nauseating, noisy mess",ryan_aus0427,August/2013,1/10,"A late night car chase through the cosmopolitan streets of Sofia, Bulgaria; throbbing with that distinct and exotic coolness European cities exude when darkness falls... it's an idea that could have been executed very well. Unfortunately not in the case of Getaway, which instead slaughters the idea so poorly you can't help but feel sorry for it. Everyone loves a good car chase. You won't find one in Getaway though. All the chase scenes are nothing more than a nauseating rapid succession of very brief cuts. It's literally   impossible to get a wider picture and understanding of what is going. Many scenes could have been quite impressive if they had just been shot at a wider angle and held a longer frame. This does not happen once though. The breakneck speed at which the cuts are made (close up of car headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back to headlights) just doesn't allow the chase to flow and is frustrating to watch. How can one appreciate what's happening when they can't even see what's happening?Selena Gomez may be trying to break out of her Disney image (and good for her) but that doesn't mean she's suited to every role. Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable, but it's only one taste bud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves. There's pretty much zero laughs, the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly, the chase scenes are visually unwatchable, it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre. Fortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed, rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess. I tried my best to enjoy the film, but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.  ",0,"[late, night, car, chase, cosmopolitan, street, sofia, bulgaria, throb, distinct, exotic, coolness, european, city, exude, darkness, fall, idea, could, execute, well, unfortunately, case, getaway, instead, slaughter, idea, poorly, help, feel, sorry, everyone, love, good, car, chase, find, one, getaway, though, chase, scene, nothing, nauseate, rapid, succession, brief, cut, literally, impossible, get, wider, picture, understand, go, many, scene, could, quite, impressive, shot, wider, angle, held, longer, frame, happen, though, breakneck, speed, cut, make, close, car, headlight, allow, chase, flow, frustrate, watch, one, appreciate, happen, even, see, happen, selena, gomez, may, try, break, disney, image, good, mean, suit, every, role, performance, feel, ...]","[a late night car chase, through, the cosmopolitan streets, of, sofia, bulgaria, throbbing, with that, distinct and, exotic coolness european cities, exude, when, darkness, falls, it, is, an idea, could have been executed, very well, unfortunately not, in, the case, of, getaway, instead slaughters, the idea, so, poorly, you, cannot help, feel, sorry, for, it. everyone, loves, a good car chase, you, will not find, in, getaway, though, all the chase scenes, are, nothing, more, than, nauseating, rapid succession, of, very brief cuts, it, is, literally  , impossible, to, get, a wider picture, understanding, of, is going, many scenes, could have been, quite impressive, if, they, had just been, shot, at, a wider angle, held, a longer frame, does not happen, once though, the breakneck speed, at, which the cuts, are made, close, up of, car, headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back, to, headlights, just does not allow, the chase, to, flow, is, frustrating, to, watch, how, can, appreciate, is happening, when, they, cannot even see, is happening?selena, gomez, ...]",-0.018325838001358244,-0.02285832630189227,1,0,1

Idris Elba does a good job as the Church guy and Ciarin Hinds is decent as the Devil.Overall, this is a over-the-top superhero film that doesn't deserve widespread hate, but still is pretty bad.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) - IMDb, A mindless CGI-fest that's so bad it's kind of funny.,lnvicta29,April/2015,4/10,"Okay, I'm a Nic Cage fanboy. Let's get that out of the way. I'll watch anything the guy does no matter how terrible the reviews are, and sometimes I'll be pleasantly surprised, as was the case with ""Seeking Justice"", ""Drive Angry"", and ""Kiss of Death"". The guy has some hidden gems in his career. Is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance one of them? Hell no.The first Ghost Rider was campy and stupid, but it was a watchable popcorn action movie and it had Eva Mendes (hence, watchable). Spirit of Vengeance is just stupid. Everything about it is stupid. No part of this movie is fleshed out and none of it is interesting. It throws you right into the action with no exposition. It's just a bunch of things happening on screen oozing with CGI to make up for the complete lack of substance. You can tell this is the same guy that directed Crank: the difference is that movie didn't need any substance because the premise was so fun. This movie just pisses on Ghost Rider's origin (literally) and expects you to enjoy watching sh*t blow up for the sake of sh*t blowing up. The writing in this movie is especially horrendous; did they hire a 10 year old to do the screenplay? It sure as hell seems like it.So you may be asking yourself, ""why give it a 4/10 if it's so awful?"" Well, I'm a sucker for laughably bad movies and this definitely qualifies. I mean, the dialogue alone tries to take itself seriously but ends up providing really good unintentional laughs. But I'll be fair, not all of this movie sucks.Nicolas Cage is always enjoyable to watch. You can tell he's invested in the role, and his dedication really holds this movie together. Idris Elba is also in this movie for some reason and he's great in anything, even if his character is completely throwaway. The other acting is serviceable I guess. You can't really blame any actors here because it's obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGI-fest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit, the CGI in this movie is pretty cool. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. So in a nutshell, you don't need to see this movie. You really don't. Not even the great Nicolas Cage is enough to hold this piece of trash together. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.

Ghost in the Shell (1995) - IMDb, Important science fiction,Hopper-230,March/2001,10/10,"Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years.Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and later Orwell's ""1984"". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. ""2001"" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where ""2001"" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins.Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain?Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, ""Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences"".Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinating dialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. ""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.""Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film. This is one of the few movies ever made that everyone should watch at least once.",1,"[ghost, visually, stun, animate, masterpiece, japanese, animation, always, class, even, attempt, describe, incredible, attention, detail, beautiful, imagery, movie, case, animation, merely, ice, one, important, work, science, fiction, recent, generation, book, movie, contribute, collective, understand, reality, prior, world, war, ii, include, book, like, yevgeny, zamyatin, huxley, brave, new, world, later, orwell, today, warning, future, fall, category, science, fiction, science, fiction, begin, fill, role, arthur, clarke, warn, us, potential, humanity, create, intelligent, even, sentient, computer, could, murder, human, creator, envision, computer, intelligence, imprison, physical, body, computer, left, ghost, tell, story, future, computer, program, project, becomes, begin, quest, fill, basic, need, feel, qualifier, ...]","[ghost, in, the she, will is, a visually stunning animated masterpiece, japanese animation, has always been, in, a class, of, its, own, so i, will, not even attempt, to, describe, the incredible attention, to, detail, beautiful imagery, in, this movie, in, case, the animation, is, merely icing, for, is, of, the most important works, of, science fiction, in, recent, years.every generation, has had, books and movies, have contributed, to, our collective understanding, of, reality, prior, to, world war ii, included, books, like, yevgeny zamyatin, we, huxley, brave new world, later orwell, today most warnings, about, the future fall, into, the category, of, science fiction, science fiction, began, to, fill, this role, when, arthur c. clarke, warned, us, of, the potential, for, humanity, to, create, intelligent, even sentient computers, could murder, their human creators, envisioned, computer intelligence, imprisoned, in, the physical body, of, a computer, where, left, off, ghost, in, the she, will, begins.ghost, in, the she, will tells, the story, ...]",-0.04812479029956879,-0.09566442833630397,1,0,0
Ghost in the Shell (1995) - IMDb, Interesting Themes Mean Nothing Without Proper Execution,DonaldDooD20,July/2014,3/10,"Ghost in the Shell seems to be as lucky as Blade Runner and Akira, blindsiding its audience with novelty and a false sense of depth. Its one of those films where people love to talk what its ""about"", but have little to say on how it portrays its themes. They say its ""about"" conscious, identity, and our dim future...but why should we care?For me, a film must have strong characters to anchor you to the story. They must be realistic and relateable, so you can understand and emphasize with their experiences. But to call GitS's characters two-dimensional is stretching the definition. The story is so focused on the case, we rarely spend any time with the cast, and thus I couldn't care about their interactions or fate. The main character is especially uninteresting: when she supposedly undergoes a great change at the end of the film, she's just as wooden as before.The sacrifice of character isn't even worth the sci-fi, cyber mystery thrills. The plot is so bloated with techno-babel its almost incomprehensible. This isn't depth that requires multiple viewings to understand - this is just bad writing. With little emotion attached to the scenes, I barely maintained attention. Only a few action scenes are scattered through the film, and none are worth the wait.I will concede the animation is pretty good, especially the backgrounds. They're cartoons, but dark, detailed, and realistic. You get a decent sense of this advanced, yet dismal world. If only this quality were in a better film! Its easy to deride those against this film as people who ""just don't get it"". I'd say there's nothing important to take away. Its world is barely explored outside of the premise, and the lone conflict between the main character and villain is so bizarre it has no bearing to reality. Imagination and presentation does not equal depth. Ghost in the Shell felt like it needed another 30 minutes to explain things and develop its themes and characters. Its easily one of the worst films I have watched in terms of writing, but at least it looks good, and is a short burn. With the large amount of sci-fi we have access to these days, I wouldn't recommend GitS to anyone.",0,"[ghost, seems, lucky, blade, runner, akira, blindsiding, audience, novelty, false, sense, depth, one, film, people, love, talk, little, say, portrays, theme, say, conscious, identity, dim, future, care, film, must, strong, character, anchor, story, must, realistic, relateable, understand, emphasize, experience, call, git, character, stretch, definition, story, focus, case, rarely, spend, time, cast, thus, could, care, interaction, fate, main, character, especially, uninteresting, supposedly, undergoes, great, change, end, film, wooden, sacrifice, character, even, worth, cyber, mystery, thrill, plot, bloat, almost, incomprehensible, depth, requires, multiple, viewing, understand, bad, write, little, emotion, attach, scene, barely, maintain, attention, action, scene, scatter, film, none, worth, concede, animation, ...]","[ghost, in, the she, will seems, to, be, as lucky, as, blade runner and akira, blindsiding, its audience, with, novelty and a false sense, of, depth, its, of, those films, where, people, love, to, talk, its, about, have, little, to, say, on, how, it, portrays, its themes, they, say, its, about, conscious, identity, our, dim future...but, why, should, we, care?for, me, a film, must have, strong characters, to, anchor, you, to, the story, they, must be, realistic and relateable, so, you, can understand, emphasize, with, their experiences, to, call, gits, characters two-dimensional, is stretching, the definition, the story, is so focused, on, the case, we, rarely spend, any time, with, the cast, thus i, could, not, care, about, their interactions or fate, the main character, is, especially uninteresting, when, she, supposedly undergoes, a great change, at, the end, of, the film, she, is, just as wooden, as, ...]",-0.1304603055515211,0.0906653627738145,1,1,3
Ghost in the Shell 2.0 (2008) - IMDb, An ill-advised venture.,fastfoodi7,January/2009,6/10,"The new scenes are nicely executed for the most part, but completely unnecessary. As eye-candy on their own, they're not particularly impressive either. Further, they tend to break the flow of the film, especially when cutting directly from the new CG to the cel-animated original. Clearly, the entire film should have been revisited rather than this selective and perfunctory approach to an update. It reeks of something George Lucas would do (i say that negatively) and sadly, GITS2.0 fails to live up to his much more seamless updates of the original STAR WARS films.More importantly, some shots lose their original intent somewhat, for example the scene where Motoko rises to the surface during her dive; also the angel-vision that Motoko has just prior to being blasted by snipers was diluted. There are little details added here and there like rain etc, which do add to the atmosphere, but ultimately i was left wondering about the intentions of the people that carried out this re-envisioning. I cannot for a moment believe that Oshii was consulted regarding small but important decisions like changing the sex of the Puppet Master from male to female. In the absence of the original director's blessing, i have no choice but to condemn what seems to be a superficial attempt at re-marketing a classic.As an introduction to the franchise, GITS2.0 is still more than adequate, but it merely offers a diminished and disjointed experience compared to watching the original.The sound FX are improved, although lacking in subtlety.

Ghosts of Mars (2001) - IMDb," Almost a quarter of a century since The Thing, and still people don't get Carpenter.",wierzbowskisteedman22,October/2005,8/10,"Firstly, if I see another review labelling Ghosts of Mars, Vampires or Escape from L.A 'Carpenter attempting to have another hit movie' my head will explode like Snake Plissken's would have done. Hello people: CARPENTER HAS NEVER HAD A HIT MOVIE! Besides maybe Halloween, Starman, Christine and Escape from New York to a lesser extent, Carpenter has made bomb after bomb. Certainly the films that have the biggest following today; The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live, they all were torn apart on release. So, surprise surprise everyone hates Ghost of Mars like they did The Thing. Now, I am in no way comparing Ghosts to The Thing, which is an vastly superior film. But Ghosts is in the same position; as it will be in fifteen years time when people will look back on it and say 'Maybe it wasn't that bad.' WHICH IT ISN'T. What elements in this film aren't Carpenter? The western atmosphere? The focus on action and story, and not character? Vast hoards of nameless enemies? These were all in Assault on Precinct 13. Oh wait, no one liked that in 1976 because they were so brain dead they had to wait for a cult following to develop before they gave it a second chance. So it must be the structure. Is the structure, with it's flashbacks-within-flashbacks and weird editing any more bizarre than the corkscrew science behind 'Prince of Darkness'? Oh that's right, everyone hated that in 1987. So I'm looking for the faults. That's it, the action isn't very good. Oh damn, it wasn't very good in 'Big Trouble in Little China' either. Wait, didn't it take people fifteen years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice Cube in the lead. Yeah, Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a non-actor take the leadoh wait, Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made in 2001 that would be bashed for having an non-actor carrying it, but for some reason because it was made in 1988 (blasted on release) Roddy Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.All said and complained about, if Ghosts of Mars was released in 1987 or something it wouldn't be getting bashed now. Hell, Jason Statham might have been the new Kurt Russell. There's plenty of fun to be had here, and Carpenter certainly hasn't 'lost his vision' as a lot of the so-called fans who are stuck somewhere around 1982 claim. If anything, with Ghosts of Mars and it's OTT structure, Carpenter is developing on it.Maybe it's just me, but I can't understand how someone can hate Ghost of Mars and have unconditional love for Assault on Precinct 13. Give Ghosts another go, and watch it with an open mind.

Just think of the 1982 classic ""The Thing"", which is simply excellent. He didn't write that movie, but the cinematography is very good. Unfortunately he DID write ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" a few years back, and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote ""Ghosts of Mars"" (referred to as GOM from now on), which sucks even more. I'm a fan of horror, sci-fi, monster movies and dramas.This movie is none of the above, but it tries to be a horror movie against a sci-fi setting. It's quite tragic because all it becomes is a lame monster movie on Mars. Or wait... this movie is actually just a western in space...with monsters.SO WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT? Well, lots of things. To begin with the movie is set in the year 2176 or something. About 170 years from now. One of the first things one notices is the fashion of 2176. Remember ""Star Trek"" the original series with Kirk? Everything looked like a space-up:ed 1970s, right? Same here, but late 90s. What about technology then? Embaressing. Almost nothing has improved. Many things are ridiculous to be set 170 years from now. Sure, it's the early colonisation of Mars and tech isn't really high in the colonies. But some of the things you'll see are just silly.What about guns? There are alot of guns in the movie, seing how it's a western and all. Well for starters how do Berettas and SPAS-12s sound? No? Don't have a place in 2176? That's right, they won't have a role at all, they'll be 200 year old antiquities. There's also an automatic rifle, which I've forgotten the name of. I think it's a FN model, about 10 years old. What is it doing there? Oh well, in the absolute ending sequence a pair ofSMGs appear that are unidentifiable, as they're tailor-made for the movie (finally). But I must say they're some of the shiniest guns I've ever seen. The design is bad, I'll accept that. But why are they so shiny? Ridiculous.***WARNING ""SPOILER"" BELOW***The opening scene of GOM is a really bad attempt at copying the Ripley investigations scenes from the all-time brilliant movie ""Aliens"". Natasha is being questioned about the recent events on Mars, where she starts recanting the movie. So after about 4 minutes into the movie, we already know that she's the only survivor. Great...nice spoiler. So the whole ""who's gonna make it"" is off, now what? That is often the only thing movies like GOM and ""Pitch Black"" have going for them, But GOM gives it away in the opening sequence. Very poor.What also bothers me are flashback scenes that aren't called for. When a person starts to explain something, we are taken back to a scene we've seen and are shown it again, just to know what the conversation refers to. It seems John Carpenter must've known we'd be sleeping ourselves through this movie.Again the western style is apparent, the law enforcers (read Sheriff and his deputies) have shotguns and the sheriff has a long coat typical of western movies. There's an old style iron bar jail, the railroad (Mars express or whatever) and a bunch of outlaws (the ghosts).So what about the bad guys in the movie? I almost s**t a brick when I saw them. They suck bad. They are simple miners than have been possessed by the ghosts and suddenly start piercing and painting and sickly decorating themselves. It's explained as something the ghosts used to do when they were alive....*sigh*....Oh well, they have this leader guy and he looks like a devil or something, in the gothiest outfit I've ever seen in a sci-fi. It's leather, it's black, it has rings and stuff, bla, bla. The funniest part is when this guy issues commands or preaches to his flock. It's like he only can say one word and that word is something like ""waah"" or perhaps ""raah"". And he wants to say these complicated sentences of about 8-14 words each. But all that comes out is ""waah, waah, raah, raah, waah, waah, raah, waaaaaah"". I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a coma. And he's REALLY p***ed all through the movie. He's supposed to be mad because invaders (the humans) have set foot on his planet. But I'd say his rage is so immense that he's got a personal issue of some kind. He's just sooo mad. Maybe it's because he can't say any other words than ""waah"" and ""raah"". I know that would p**s me off.The religious manner in which his subordinates worship him, with this whole ""primitive caveman meets Jehova's witness bent on Nazi occultism"" style is pathetic.THE ACTORS Natasha Henstridge (ze girrrl from Schpecies) can do better, she's no actress, nor a model, but even she can do better. Ice Cube actually isn't all that bad, he proved that in ""Boyz 'n' the Hood"" among other films, this must be the worst performance from him that I've ever seen, much due to the script.This movie so badly wants to be a good SCI-FI, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good WESTERN, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good MONSTER MOVIE, but it can't because the script and props suck.OK, what about budget? Well ""John Carpenter"" is a name that should allow for some money to pour in. Hm...but not if the sponsors saw ""John Carpenter's Vampires"". I believe most of the money went into making the train that traffics Mars. The design is bad, humans would never build anything like that train. It looks OK though, in being actually there I mean. It's OK...nothing more. Explosions are plentiful (the ghosts have dynamite) and bad. Everyone's on a springboard and fly in a predictable trajectory in order to not hurt themselves. Typical ""A-Team"" action complete with tons of clichés and lame Wesley Snipes-like comments.Do I sound a tad irritated? That is because I payed good money to view this movie. I feel people have the right to know what to expect as I have the right to be upset about what I saw. This review contains no profanity so there should be no reason to not post it.Overall : I gave it a 1 in my vote.

Gladiator (2000) - IMDb, Breathtaking!,angelo-296,June/2000,10/10,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears.

Godsend (2004) - IMDb," Has potential, but it's a bit like watching molasses in January",BrandtSponseller20,February/2005,7/10,"After losing their son, Adam (Cameron Bright), to a freak accident, Paul (Greg Kinnear) and Jessie Duncan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), with a risky and illegal idea--to try ""replacing"" Adam with a clone.In my way of looking at ratings, 7s are Cs. They tend to do as many things wrong as right. Godsend has some admirable script characteristics, a good to great cast and some very good technical aspects. But it also has negative script characteristics and some questionable directing and editing.Overall, I believe Godsend is worth watching, so let's look at the positive points first. It's rare that filmic science fiction--and this is just as much as science fiction film as a thriller or horror film--tries to tackle ""hard science"" as exposition and motivation. Although Godsend also mixes some strong fantasy elements into its ""twist"" and the consequences that lead to the film being a thriller/horror picture, the basic idea is one rooted in actual genetics. De Niro is given quite a few mouthfuls of science-oriented dialogue that are fairly sound, and for my money, he delivers them well.I'm a big fan of De Niro's, so I tend to be gracious in my evaluation of his work. But I could see where some viewers less enamored with De Niro overall might find his performance here questionable. It's certainly a bit different than normal, being oddly restrained and almost emotionless for much of the film. For me, that approach fit the character, given his profession and eventual revelations about his personality. The other three principles--Kinnear, Romijn-Stamos and Bright--were good in my view, but again I can see where some viewers could interpret their performances negatively. To me, however, all of the obvious problems stem from direction and editing, not the actors' work.The biggest problem seems to stem from director Nick Hamm's comments about the horror/thriller genre. He has stated, ""what was interesting to me about Godsend was that the horror and the suspense had nothing to do with anything supernatural or spiritual"". Hamm isn't a very big fan of the fantasy aspect of horror, which to me, translates into not being a very big horror fan. This led to trying to create a horror film where suspense arises out of realist drama and psychological situations. The realist drama in Godsend tends to be very slow and relatively uneventful--just as one might expect from someone not really wanting to make a horror film. Psychological horror is barely approached. There just isn't enough that happens. There are two potential villains, but neither does much. It would be very difficult to call either ""evil"".Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos aren't given enough to work with. They don't have anything very meaty to react to. Hamm seems too afraid to leave realist drama territory, at least in terms of the overall plot/action. That makes some of their ""horrified"" reactions seem shallow or false. Worse, Hamm doesn't seem to know how to cut horror films very well. Scenes go on far longer than they should, and occasionally almost seem as if we're seeing a bit of the footage either before Hamm said ""Action"" or after he called ""Cut"". A prime example of this is the scene near the end when Romijn-Stamos is walking through woods toward a shed.Godsend is also one of the few cases where copious DVD extras may have hurt the film more than helped. The DVD contains four alternate endings, averaging about 12 minutes long each. These occasionally deviate strongly from the theatrical ending, but none seem quite satisfying (all of the more nihilistic endings that Hamm described on his commentary but which apparently weren't shot would have done the trick for me; I also liked the filmed tag suggesting a sequel). They all tend to drag on, an impression that isn't helped by the lack of a score and a sound effects soundtrack.Also curious, given Hamm's dislike of the fantasy aspects of genre films, is the fact that the crux of the ""twist"" in Godsend is extremely loopy. What's happening with Adam makes little sense from a realistic/scientific standpoint, and how it happened just isn't possible. Of course, I'm not averse to fantasy, and I don't subtract points for elements in film that are wildly divergent from our beliefs and understanding of the actual world. But if Hamm is going to abandon realism when it comes to important plot points, why not abandon it wholesale, so that we can maybe see a film that deserves an A instead?",1,"[lose, son, adam, cameron, bright, freak, accident, paul, greg, kinnear, jessie, duncan, rebecca, approach, richard, well, robert, de, niro, risky, illegal, idea, try, replace, adam, way, look, rating, c, tend, many, thing, wrong, right, godsend, admirable, script, characteristic, good, great, cast, good, technical, aspect, also, negative, script, characteristic, questionable, direct, believe, godsend, worth, watch, let, us, look, positive, point, first, rare, filmic, science, fiction, much, science, fiction, film, thriller, horror, film, try, tackle, hard, science, exposition, motivation, although, godsend, also, mix, strong, fantasy, element, twist, consequence, lead, film, picture, basic, idea, one, root, actual, genetics, de, niro, give, quite, mouthful, ...]","[after, losing, their son, adam, cameron, bright, to, a freak accident, paul, greg kinnear, jessie duncan, rebecca romijn-stamos, are approached, by, dr, richard wells, robert de niro, with, risky and, illegal idea--to try, replacing, adam, with, a clone.in my way, of, looking, at, ratings, 7s, are, cs, they, tend, to, do, as, many things, wrong, as, right, godsend, has, some admirable script characteristics, good, to, great, cast and some very good technical aspects, it, also has, negative script characteristics, some questionable directing, editing.overall, i, believe godsend is, worth watching, so let, us, look, at, the positive points, first, it, is, rare, that, filmic science, fiction--and, is, just as much, as, science fiction film, as, a thriller, horror film--tries, to, tackle, hard science, as, exposition and motivation, although, godsend, also, mixes, some strong fantasy elements, into, its, twist, the consequences, lead, to, the film, being, a thriller/horror picture, the basic idea, is, rooted, in, actual genetics, niro, is given, ...]",-0.10856188105696113,0.04321225781705372,1,1,3

Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity.",1,"[haider, acronym, mean, follow, haunt, background, score, music, lyric, playback, especially, rekha, bharadwaj, sukhwinder, singh, arijit, singh, cinematography, backdrop, kashmir, haider, haunt, film, stay, long, left, astound, haider, astoundingly, adept, adaptation, classic, write, almost, year, ago, enjoy, irrespective, knowledge, shakespearean, tragedy, hamlet, know, hamlet, great, even, better, incredible, haider, incredible, term, performance, shahid, kapoor, performs, complex, role, kind, award, worthy, chutzpah, silence, detractor, matter, triumvirate, tabu, ethereal, dauntless, supreme, kay, kay, menon, terrific, resolute, subtle, irfan, khan, ghost, hamlet, u, father, rudimentary, underplayed, forgotten, shraddha, kapoor, pitch, performance, perfect, full, finesse, course, two, salman, khan, fan, superstar, surely, gain, fan, ...]","[haider, to, me, is, an acronym, means, the following:h, haunting, be, it, in, its background score, music, lyrics, playback, especially rekha bharadwaj, sukhwinder singh, arijit singh, cinematography, backdrop, of, kashmir, in, haider, is, haunting, how, the film, will stay, with, you, long, after, you, have left, the theater.a, astounding, haider, is, an astoundingly adept adaptation, of, classic written, almost, 415 years, ago that can be enjoyed, irrespective, of, your knowledge, about, the shakespearean tragedy, hamlet, if, you, do not know, hamlet, great, you, do, even better, incredible, haider, is, incredible, in, terms, of, its performances, be, it, that, of, shahid kapoor, haider/hamlet, performs, a complex role, with, the kind, of, award worthy chutzpah, should silence, all his detractors, once, for, for that, matter, the the triumvirate, of, tabu, halala/gertrude, ethereal, dauntless, supreme, kay kay menon, khurram/claudius, terrific, resolute, subtle, irfan, rooh/the ghost, of, ...]",-0.07807260449430525,-0.14736121028697774,1,0,0

Half Past Dead (2002) - IMDb, Half Past Doughnut,Rob_Taylor10,April/2003,4/10,"Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then get a writer/director to pen a plot even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names. Finally, add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore. The result? Half Past Dead. An action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through. The plot holes are stupendously, glaringly large - for example, prisoners who, when the jail is invaded, fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape. Or how about the prison itself, which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (bearing a striking resemblance to a Huey) with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose.Then there's Seagal himself. I like the guy. He CAN fight. He's even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But all through the movie I kept hoping for that one great, defining fight scene. Never happened. Instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole Hell of a lot. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub-machinegun at them, there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target. Yet somehow they miss? Even the A-Team would cringe at this foolishness. And then when it gets to any kind of one-on-one physical stuff, we get treated to a shabby Matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet-time. People getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense.C'mon Steven, you're better than this. Your career can't be over. Say it ain't so!This is instantly forgettable (except I'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watch it, try to find it amusing in an A-Team kind of way.

Harakiri (1962) - IMDb, Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,noralee16,September/2005,10/10,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",1,"[saw, harakiri, seppuku, new, mm, print, nyc, film, forum, brilliant, use, narrow, period, genre, explosively, indict, politics, culture, writer, shinobu, hashimoto, yasuhiko, takiguchi, surely, must, inspire, count, monte, cristo, ambrose, bierce, howard, hawk, western, much, samurai, literature, film, begin, deceptively, story, within, story, seemingly, provide, traditional, example, uphold, samurai, honor, conventional, tale, ronin, context, set, time, central, government, shogunate, supplant, local, clan, arbitrarily, unemploying, thousand, people, notably, samurai, force, mercenary, mode, ronin, best, beg, food, bad, parallel, century, make, repeatedly, explicit, samurai, come, clan, seek, help, gradually, get, insight, tale, within, tale, see, flashback, within, flashback, character, confrontation, get, uneasy, ...]","[i, saw, harakiri, seppuku, in, new, 35 mm print, at, nyc, film forum, is, a brilliant use, of, a narrow period genre, to, explosively indict, politics and culture, writers, shinobu hashimoto, yasuhiko takiguchi, surely must have been, as, inspired, by, the count, of, monte cristo, ambrose bierce and howard hawks, westerns, as much, as by, literature and movies.the film, begins, deceptively, as, a story, within, a story, seemingly providing, a traditional example, of, upholding, honor, such, as in, the conventional, oft-retold tale, of, the 47 ronin, the context, is set, at, a time, when, the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting, local clans, arbitrarily unemploying thousands, of, people, notably, their, forcing, them, into, the mercenary mode, of, ronin, at, best, begging, for, food, at, worse, the parallels, to, the 20th century, are made, repeatedly explicit, as, comes, to, this clan, seeking help is, from, hiroshima.very gradually we, get, further insight, on, the tale, within, a tale, as, we, see, more flashbacks, within, flashbacks, ...]",-0.09768004521570219,-0.098444443898528,1,0,1
Hard Boiled (1992) - IMDb, My number 1 personal favorite John Woo's best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time!,ivo-cobra81,January/2018,10/10,"Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite Hong Kong John Woo action film that I love to death! I absolutely love this movie to death I love it. It is one of my personal favorite movies. Hard Boiled (1992) is literally John Woo's best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time! The movie is a hard-core action, I have ever seen. It is actually the best Hong Kong action film for me. It belongs right up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the best action classic film of all time. Chow Yun-Fat, toothpick in mouth, a gun in each hand. That's all of the plot you need to know. In fact, this is THE best pure action epic ever filmed. This is my film, my personal favorite Hong Kong action film of all time.""Give the guy a gun and he's superman, give him two and he's God.""Not even Jackie Chan can mess with this film or beat it. The only Jackie Chan film that is close to this film is Police Story. In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo's best HK action movie from the 90's and a true masterpiece along with Hard Target (1993) his first American movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the main role. Chow Yun-Fat stars as Tequila, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hit man hangs on thread.Hard Boiled is my favorite John Woo's HK action movies. This action movie with twists around, The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it, no CGI, the stunts are real, the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The warehouse scenes and a shooting a motorcycles in an explosions from Tequila is my favorite scenes in the movie. Sometimes to me it come for this movie is similar to Miami Vice when Tony Leung was undercover cop on a boat he remind me on Sonny Crockett, but the shout outs in this film are awesome. Just Miami Vice TV series where more about drug cartels, this is arms dealer weapons about triads. The stunts are real and very dangerous. There was a hospital siege which was actually Die Hard in a hospital. Hard Boiled is a classic action film from Hong Kong, they don't make movies like this anymore. Phillip Chan is also in this film which I forgot to mention in my review Philip Chan was also in Van Damme's Bloodsport. You have a great action sequences in the tea house, where the guns are hitting in the bird cage, he shoots a dozen guys and saves a baby, the hospital sequences are real. The first time I saw this film I had no idea that how great film it is, the greatest movie of all time in the cinema. John Woo is also as a bartender in this film. The hospital sequences for me is real, the action is real. The best Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo movie ever made. Hard Boiled is a 1992 Hong Kong action film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo.

Hard Boiled (1992) - IMDb," Bullets, ballet and bloodletting. Oh, and Bonkers!",j30bell22,December/2004,5/10,"There can be few cop movies which can boast a body count higher than Spielberg's entire Omaha Beach Landing in the first 5 minutes. Possibly no cop film except, of course, Hard Boiled.Hard Boiled is John Woo's Hong Kong swansong, and many regard it as his finest film. It stars young Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, two of the finest actors in Hong Kong; the usual ""maverick cop hunts big boss bad guy"" routine; oh, and lots and lots of blood. Imagine a slightly more realistic version of the Arnie midi-gun sequence in T2  more realistic in that when someone starts firing a midi-gun and blowing up cars, the cops get killed. That, in a nutshell, is the plot of Hardboiled. All two hours and six minutes of it.The plot  well that makes about as much sense as a wolverine in a fruit salad, but I'm not sure addicts of HK Cinema care too much about that. Tequila (maverick cop and certified nutcase with a heart of gold - Chow Yun Fat) shouts and swears at his boss, shoots up bad guys, gets drunk and ends up (implausibly, if iconically) in a hospital, holding a baby in one hand and a shot gun in the other. Tony Leung lives Miami Vice-Style on a boat (alas, no Alligator) while committing murder, getting paid by the HK Police, and wearing loose tee-shirts with white jackets.If all this sounds like style over substance  erm that's 'cos it is.The film definitely has its moments. In fact, like most John Woo films, it seems mostly to be a series of moments strung together to feature length. It also has some real grit. I appreciated the scene where a regular cop kills an undercover cop by mistake in a raid. Realistic, and not something that Hollywood would ever broach (the closest to this is in a truly class film like The Reservoir Dogs).However, while this is a true Hong Kong bullets and ballet classic, Western audiences are likely to feel slightly cheated by its totally bonkers story. Less bonkers than many, perhaps, but that's not really saying much.I enjoyed it. It was a guilty pleasure, but I'm man enough to admit I enjoyed it. John Woo has yet to make a better film. And has never yet made a sensible one, so don't blame him or me if you find it a bit daft. 5/10 (but watchable).",0,"[cop, movie, boast, body, count, high, spielberg, entire, omaha, beach, land, first, minute, possibly, cop, film, except, course, hard, boil, john, woo, hong, kong, swansong, many, regard, fine, film, star, young, chow, tony, leung, chiu, wai, two, fine, actor, hong, kong, usual, maverick, cop, hunt, big, bos, bad, guy, routine, oh, lot, lot, blood, imagine, slightly, realistic, version, arnie, sequence, realistic, someone, start, fire, blowing, car, cop, get, kill, nutshell, plot, hardboiled, two, hour, six, minute, plot, well, make, much, sense, wolverine, fruit, salad, sure, addict, hk, cinema, care, much, tequila, maverick, cop, certify, nutcase, heart, gold, chow, yun, fat, ...]","[can be, few cop movies, can boast, a body count, higher, than, spielberg, entire omaha beach landing, in, first, 5 minutes, possibly, no cop film, except, of, course, hard, boiled.hard boiled is john woo, hong kong swansong, many regard it, as, his finest film, it, stars, young chow, yun-fat and, tony leung chiu wai, of, the finest actors, in, hong kong, usual, maverick cop, hunts, big boss, bad guy, routine, lots, lots, of, blood, imagine, a slightly more realistic version, of, the arnie, midi-gun sequence, in, t2 , more realistic, in that, when, someone, starts firing, midi-gun, blowing, up, cars, the cops, get killed, that, in, a nutshell, is, the plot, of, hardboiled, all two hours, six minutes, of, it.the plot , well, makes, about as, much sense, as, a wolverine, in, a fruit salad, i, am, not sure addicts, of, hk cinema care, too much, about, that, tequila, maverick cop, certified, nutcase, with, a heart, of, gold, chow yun, fat, shouts, swears, at, his boss, ...]",-0.10661041158273661,-0.0035962374909228184,1,1,1
Hera Pheri (2000) - IMDb, A light comedy everyone will enjoy,chutneylix28,March/2002,10/10,"I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

Hera Pheri (2000) - IMDb," ""Don't plan for expenditure before we get money.""",classicsoncall23,March/2018,3/10,"There apparently is something I'm missing big time with this film. The effusive praise by many reviewers on this board calling it the best or funniest movie ever is completely lost on me. At present, I've seen an even dozen pictures from India, and they run the gamut from excellent (2015's ""Drishyam"") to dumb and dumber (""Andaz, Apna, Apna""). By further comparison, 2009's ""3 Idiots"" was immensely more satisfying to watch than the three idiots in this picture. To be quite honest, the principal reason I'm drawn to Hindi titles is their placement on IMDb's 'Top 250' film lists, with a personal goal of watching and reviewing all the ones I can. This one, I have to tell you, was a chore to get through. Since we're talking in three's here, this would have made more sense to be called 'The Three Stooges of India', in which case I would have been better prepared for the pratfalls and nonsense going on. By this time I'm well aware that Hindi films often easily exceed two hours, padded by a handful of musical song and dance numbers. That was the case here as well, but my oh my, the second one in this story had to go at least ten minutes. It was so long that one of the principal characters had four or five wardrobe changes!

High Noon (1952) - IMDb, Remarkably well-organised western in which not one single second is wasted and the tension is built up admirably.,barnabyrudge16,April/2006,10/10,"John Wayne was totally wrong to call this movie un-American. Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose ""history"" with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"" by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces. There's nothing else to say - if you haven't already, go out and see this film NOW!",1,"[john, wayne, totally, wrong, call, movie, courage, cowardice, universal, emotion, attitude, character, high, noon, think, incredibly, truthful, tell, know, live, wild, west, job, family, ask, stand, fight, gang, psycho, would, probably, able, gary, cooper, kane, remarkable, character, term, morality, inner, strength, way, must, uphold, law, even, though, perhaps, cost, wife, life, various, townfolk, u, identify, even, make, us, feel, shame, unworthiness, admit, matter, bravely, act, much, want, think, heroically, us, would, cower, shadow, time, come, kane, wedding, day, dependable, lawman, kane, gary, cooper, hand, badge, prepare, leave, town, bride, amy, grace, kelly, receives, devastate, news, old, adversary, frank, miller, ian, ...]","[john wayne, was, totally wrong, to, call, this movie, un-american, courage and cowardice, are, universal emotions, the attitudes, of, the characters, in, high noon, are, i, think, incredibly truthful, telling, i know, that if, i, lived, in, the wild west, had, a job, family, was asked, to, stand, up, fight, against, a gang, of, gun-toting psychos, i would probably not be, able, to, do, it, is, why, gary cooper, will kane is such, a remarkable character, in, terms, of, self-respect, morality and inner strength, it, is, the way he, must uphold, the law, even, though, it, will, perhaps, cost, him his wife and his life, it, is, the various townfolk, with, most, of, us, will identify, even, if, it, makes, us, feel shame, unworthiness, to, admit, it, no matter, how, bravely, we, act, how, much we, want, to, think, heroically, of, ourselves, of, us, would cower, in, ...]",-0.06493800964286713,-0.04727170002096492,1,0,1
High Noon (1952) - IMDb, Overrated Western,doug-balch25,June/2010,4/10,"Like ""Shane"", ""High Noon"" is another Western that has ridden to film critic heaven on the back of Oscar victories. It's up to me to point out that the emperor has no clothes. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it is overrated.Let me start with the positives:The movie is well paced. There is good tension. Most characters are well developed. It is well acted. Katy Kurtado, who has the only quality supporting role as a Mexican store owner/slut, has a great line where she tells Lloyd Bridges that Gary Cooper is better than him because ""Hees a mehn!"" Loved that.OK, I'm done with positives now.Here are the negatives:The basic plot doesn't make sense. This movie is often referred to as an example of an individual's steely resolve to stand up against wrong, even though abandoned by friends and society. But Kane runs like a rabbit as soon as he finds out the Millers are coming. It's only when he gets a couple of miles out of town that he realizes that he only has an hour head start on them. He tells his wife that they have no choice but to go back to town. ""They'll just catch us alone out in the open prairie,"" he says to Grace Kelly. ""My only chance is to stay in town and get help"".So, Kane did not stay out of principle. He stayed only because he had no other choice. Yet for the rest of the movie, Kane doesn't make that argument to the townspeople. In the final church scene, there are seven or eight men who are strongly inclined to support Kane. However, town elder Thomas Mitchell wants to avoid bad publicity and tells Kane the solution is for him to run.. Why doesn't he reply to Mitchell, ""You're telling me to commit suicide, it's too late to run. I need help now and you guys owe it to me"". Surely if he made that simple, compelling argument, his supporters would have come to his aid. Instead, he just glares at everyone and storms out.The Grace Kelly character makes absolutely no sense. How can she abandon her husband five minutes after she marries him because four guys want to kill him? He already told her that to leave town was virtual suicide. The age difference between Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper is disturbing and distracting. She looks like she's fifteen, he looks like her grandfather. Cooper was only 50 when they made this, but sadly, he was not a well man at this stage of this life. He looks closer to 60 in this movie.Kane's the hero of the story, but he's hard to admire. He seems too afraid of the bad guys. Also, he only prevails after his Quaker wife dry gulches Ben Miller. Critics wax poetic about this aspect of the movie, telling us that ""High Noon"" was the first ""anti-Western"", where the hero isn't brave. Fair enough, but I don't like anti-Westerns. I'm a Western fan. If I was anti-Western, I would watch musicals or romantic comedies, not ""High Noon"".The principal heavy is almost completely uncharacterized and is off screen for most of the movie. When he finally shows up, he looks like an accountant on vacation at a five star dude ranch. Only ""Butch Cassidy"" has a more poorly developed bad guy.What's so interesting about this movie being a metaphor for the HUAC investigation of communists in Hollywood? Who cares?And while we are on that subject, if this is movie such a liberal metaphor, what's with the tirades against weak courts releasing murderers? Isn't that a right wing rant? My head was spinning through this whole movie. ""Hounding Communists is bad and so is trial by jury.""This is a strictly back lot ""town"" Western. While movies with similar story lines obviously have few opportunities to film scenic backdrops, may directors find ways around this (George Stevens in ""Shane"", for example). This movie feels less like a real Western and more like a intellectual Broadway stage play with cowboy hats and spurs for props.There is not an iota of comic relief. I mean nada, niente, nothing. I read that Jack Elam's drunk had a comic scene deleted. Was this to keep the movie to its gimmicky ""real time"" length? If so, it wasn't worth it.Another plot hole. Mrs. Ramirez is so afraid of Frank Miller's vengeance upon her that she fire sales her business and skips town. She then proceeds to deliberately catch Miller's eye at the train station. He hardly seems to recognize her, much less attempt to punish her for her sins against him. Maybe Kane should have bought a train ticket too. It seems to provide full protection against ex-con gunslingers bent on revenge.And while we're on that subject, why would the Miller gang let Kane's wife waltz out of town on the train? Their many friends in town would surely point her out to them. Another reason Kane can't run. He has to stay to protect her, even though she's abandoned him for.....well, for staying to protect her? Like I said, the plot is irrational.The ending was much too abrupt. Another time saving measure?Finally, I'd like to know how the burning barn mysteriously extinguished itself. At the end all the townsfolk are crowding around the dead bodies, when they should have been scrambling to keep their homes from burning down.",0,"[like, shane, high, noon, another, western, ridden, film, critic, heaven, back, oscar, victory, point, emperor, clothes, say, bad, movie, start, positive, movie, well, pace, good, tension, character, well, developed, well, act, katy, kurtado, quality, support, role, mexican, store, great, line, tell, lloyd, bridge, gary, cooper, better, hees, mehn, love, do, positive, negative, basic, plot, make, sense, movie, often, refer, example, individual, steely, resolve, stand, wrong, even, though, abandon, friend, society, kane, run, like, rabbit, soon, find, miller, come, get, couple, mile, town, realizes, hour, head, start, tell, wife, choice, go, back, town, catch, u, alone, open, prairie, say, grace, kelly, ...]","[like, shane, high noon, is, another western, has ridden, to, film, critic heaven, on, back, of, oscar victories, it, is, up to, me, to, point, out that, the emperor, has, no clothes, i, am not saying, it, is, a bad movie, just, that, it, is, overrated.let me, start, with, the positives:the movie, is well paced, is, good tension, most, characters, are well developed, it, is well acted, katy kurtado, has, the only quality, supporting, role, as, a mexican store owner/slut, has, a great line, where, she, tells, lloyd bridges, that, gary cooper, is, better, than, him, because, hees, a mehn, loved, that.ok, i, am done, with, positives, now.here are, the negatives:the, basic plot, does not make, sense, this movie, is often referred, to as, an example, of, an individual, steely resolve, to, stand, up against, wrong, even, though, abandoned, by, friends and society, kane, runs, like, a rabbit, as soon, as, he, ...]",0.05505592127198653,-0.003439732773869158,0,0,0
Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) - IMDb, I prefer the Renegade Version - F**k the original version an Underrated flick!,ivo-cobra816,October/2016,8/10,"Highlander 2: Renegade Version is MILES way better than the original theatrical version! This is the version that it supposed to come out in theater but the movie was cut to 1h 31 min which was ridicules! Highlander II: The Quickening sucks ass and it is one of the worst movies of 1991! I understand why everyone hates this film and I agree with all the haters this movie sucks, but the Renegade Version does not suck! That is why I am giving a score 8 out of 10, but that doesn't mean this movie was epic, perfect or the best, on the contrary it is not even a close movie to an original film! But I like it a lot and I am going to count the reasons what I like about this version. I have a lot of problems with this sequel but Renegade Version was entertaining! I have this movie on Blu-ray Renegade Version which it really surprised me. Plot: It's 2024 and MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) and Ramirez (Sean Connery) are back to save planet Earth. Ozone depletion, time travel and corporate greed are at the core of all the thrilling twists and turns in this stylish action sequel. Featuring new state-of-the-art special effects and digital re-mastering, it's HIGHLANDER II like you've never seen or heard before.Thing's I love in this movie: Christopher Lambert is reunited with Sean Connery and director Russell Mulcahy. I absolutely love the old cast from the first film. Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery become really a beloved character from the first film. The original film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and I am glad he directed the sequel good for him. I love those three in this movie! Michael Ironside is an awesome bad ass villain as General Katana, he is not the best villain like was Clancy Brown as The Kurgan, but he was really close evil tough bad guy, that we all wanted him dead. Ironside was also the bad guy in Total Recall (1990) my all time favorite Schwarzenegger movie. That is one of the reason why I like this movie. I love that this movie is set in 2024 it is a sci-fi futuristic film, you see mostly dark and red world which it is a futuristic world and I love that in this movie.I love the song One Dream performed by Lou Gramm Band I love the song score which is perfect to this film. Highlander 2: Renegade Version really reworked the movie in to kind a the original version supposed to be: they are not really an aliens, they are kind a, just put trough time and they are finding that out. So basically one of them is shipped trough time and they shipped them trough time. They have to fight each other in a combat to the death, when you behead someone you take their energy away and when you kill all the immortals you become mortal and that is basically what happens with a Highlander 2: Renegade Version.The reason I love this movie is because it takes place in the future and it is cool, there is a guy with a wings going after him, those guys are kind a nit. They are some really kick ass fights scenes in it. I love the fact that Ramirez comes back I don't care, that it doesn't make sense or it dopes makes sense. It is Highlander, it is immortals beheading each other to become the one. It is not supposed to be realistic who cares. He use The Quickening energy to bring back Ramirez I would do it. I love that Ramirez comes back he is a cool character and I love him. I love that Brenda J. Wyatt returns in this movie but this time she is played by Karin Drexler when we find out what happened to the character from the first movie.Katana (Michael Ironside) does respect the rules, the immortals never fight on a holly ground.The sky is red in this film because of the field energy. The only problem with film I have is: The renegade version may be a better edited movie than the original crap fest The Quickening, but it still suffers from terrible screenplay which had problems from the very beginning.The fight between MacLeod and Katana was cut short and it could be a longer duel. I wish there would be more an epic swords fight like was in the first movie. Ramirez music score was horrible, Ramirez acting in this movie like an idiot was horrible. I wish they would cut those scenes out when he lands in an opera, I really wouldn't want to see that. In my opinion this is the true original sequel to the original film. Overall: I like this movie it is a childhood movie of mine I grew up watching this movie. I love sci-fi in this movie and I love Highlander 1 and 2 to death but I love Highlander (1986) the best!

Highlander: Endgame (2000) - IMDb, Finally a sequel,carlos_b8417,August/2005,7/10,"After the ""Alien Experience"" and the ""Remake Sequel"", ""Highlander"" producers decided to add two and two and get someone to write a marvellous script. They went on with the mathematics, and got together Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul. The result is the long-expected good sequel to the first ""Highlander"", set after ""The Series"" ended.Tired of the endless fights, Connor MacLeod enters the Sanctuary, a place where immortals can rest forever under the guard of the Watchers. However, an old foe of Connor releases him after killing all the other immortals in that place. Not pleased with this, this foe and his posse pays a visit to Duncan MacLeod, who gets away and looks for his clansman. Both MacLeods have sins to purge, and the time has come to do that.Christopher Lambert, though intended to have a supportive role like Sean Connery in the original film, robs the movie. Though his Connor is hardly the same bad ass of the other films, it's by far the best performance in the film. Adrian Paul manages to lead the film well, like in the TV series. Bruce Payne, playing the embittered Jacob Kell, provides a fine interpretation that is however in the line of the other ""Highlander"" villains. Lisa Barbuscia as Kate MacLeod is somewhat fine, but I'm inclined to believe the only reason ""Fishlips"" got cast is her willingness to show her breasts.The character of the film is indeed Jin Ke, played by Donnie Yen. However brief his presence on screen may be, he manages to give a very good impression, as well as some action. Another two characters worth mentioning are Rachel (the late Sheila Gish) and Heather (Beatie Edney), who appear again in a ""Highlander"" film. Briefly, but it's something.Why don't I give it a 10? First, the first film (which indeed deserves a 10) is superior to this one. Secondly, the editing of the film is weak. It's not the one of ""Highlander II: The Quickening"" but this one has some big flaws.

Highlander: Endgame (2000) - IMDb," Best since the first one for fans, but non fans beware!!!!!",Tin,Man-54/September,1/10,"About five minutes into ""Highlander: Endgame,"" the last film in the franchise which has given ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" a run for the money in the most ""unique"" fans, I realized that in the Highlander series, there are two separate universes that exist: The universe in which Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) became the final immortal and won the prize in 1986 (in the first film), and the one where, in the year 2000, the fight is still going on. In this universe, which was established in the TV series, Duncan MacLeod, Connor's younger brother (Adrian Paul) is the runner up for the prize, the major fight that took place in the first film was not the final battle between the last two immortals left, but merely one of many battles that were still to come.This film takes place in the latter series, and the final battle is at hand at long last, and it's down to two good immortals: Connor and Duncan, and an ancient, evil immortal (Bruce Payne) who has a posse of other immortals following him like he's some kind of anti-christ. He's also got a deadly agenda against Connor for something that took place in the past. It's cleverly written, so I dare not give anything away.""Endgame"" is a sequel to the first film as it took place in the TV series' universe, and a continuation of the TV show, which went off air some two years ago. In order to fully appretiate this film, the viewer needs to be familiar with both...and like them. Otherwise, he or she will get confused and bored. Make no mistake: It is a film by Highlander fans FOR Highlander fans, and little explanation is given for anything in this, because it assumes that anyone watching will be familiar with the premise and the rules of the immortal game upon entering the theater.As a serious film critic, I found the first film to be a masterpiece. Combining full-throttle thrills, an excellent premise, and top-rate performances, Highlander introduced us to the world of the immortals, and the premise was so thought-provoking that it drew the viewer in, and it made it easy for he or she to suspend their disbelief, if only for two hours. It deservedly joined the rank of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" as one of the most successful and influential sci-fi films ever written. The second film didn't do so well, but the director's cut was definitely worth watching. ""The Final Dimension"" was a poor entry, and it was the last to take place in Connor's world, where he became the final immortal and took the prize.
With all of this said, as a fan of the first film, I can tell you that if you liked it, you will fall in love with ""Highlander: Endgame."" It's name implies that it is the final chapter, and it is, but not to the film series....no, this is the final chapter in the TV show, and it nicely caps the series. It is a most satisfactory wrap-up, with all the elements that made the first film and the TV show successful: Great camera-work, intruiging characters, flashbacks from all around the world, engaging conflicts, and some of the finest sword-fighting sequences that I have ever seen put to film. And the surprise ending in which one of the MacLeods makes the ultimate sacrifice will leave no fan with a dry eye (and if you are a fan who's seen it already, DON'T PANIC! Remember, this is not the same universe as that of the film series!).There are also some nice touches that only fans will enjoy: It was wonderful to see Heather, Connor's old wife, again, if only for a few brief moments. Watching the training sequences between Connor and Duncan are also well-written (and NOT  a rip off of the stuff seen between Connor and Ramirez in the first film). The different aspects of immortality that are explored are nothing short of ingenious, and the characters of both Connor and Duncan are very nicely developed. Joe and Methos's cameos from the TV show are also appretiated.If you're not a fan, walk away slowly with your hands raised in the air. If you like the series of films and the TV show, enjoy this gem which nicely seals the Highlander universe. Indeed,for those of us who have come to realize that ""there can be only one,"" this might be the best film of the summer!***1/2 out of **** (best since the original).",0,"[five, minute, highlander, endgame, last, film, franchise, give, star, war, star, trek, run, money, unique, fan, realize, highlander, series, two, separate, universe, exist, universe, connor, macleod, christopher, lambert, become, final, immortal, prize, first, film, one, year, fight, still, go, universe, establish, tv, series, duncan, macleod, connor, young, brother, adrian, paul, runner, prize, major, fight, take, place, first, film, final, battle, last, two, immortal, left, merely, one, many, battle, still, film, take, place, latter, series, final, battle, hand, long, last, two, good, immortal, connor, duncan, ancient, evil, immortal, bruce, payne, posse, immortal, follow, like, kind, also, get, deadly, agenda, connor, something, ...]","[about, five minutes, into, highlander, endgame, the last film, in, the franchise, has given, star wars, star trek, run, for, the money, in, most, unique, fans, i, realized, that in, the highlander series, are, two separate universes, exist, the universe, in, which connor macleod, christopher lambert, became, final immortal, won, the prize, in, in, the first film, where, in, the year, the fight, is still going, on, in, this universe, was established, in, the tv series, duncan macleod, connor, younger brother, adrian paul, is, the runner, up for, the prize, the major fight, took, place, in, the first film, was, not, the final battle, between, last, two immortals, left, merely, of, many battles, were, still, to, come.this, film, takes, place, in, the latter series, the final battle, is, at, hand, at, long last, it, is, down, to, two good immortals, connor and duncan, an ancient, evil immortal, bruce payne, has, a posse, of, other immortals, following, him, ...]",-0.2313070481472301,0.1538463163156491,1,1,3
Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994) - IMDb, Highlander III: The Sorcerer,Rautus14,September/2008,8/10,"After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology.Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance.Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly.The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had.The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth.The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song ""Bonny Portmore"" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace.The special effects are okay.The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York.

Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994) - IMDb, Mildly entertaining - An improvement over II,mstomaso4,December/2005,4/10,"Just to be up-front about this - I enjoy these films. The original - Highlander - was the only one in the series which really stands the test of time (Endgame has now joined it in this), and stands head and shoulders above the others for artistic merit and originality, but still, I liked the others well enough. I also like the much maligned Christopher Lambert. He's an odd actor to be sure - far from the Hollywood norm in appearance, style and accent, but he's nothing if not original and once you understand his understated style, you might just see that the guy has some serious talent. Read on if these statements resonate with you. Otherwise, feel free to move on without reading or rating this review.Lambert is good, Unger is good, Van Peebles is campy as hell, alternating between absurdist humor and menacing poseur-ship.The script is OK, certainly less grandiose and more mindless than II (and closer to the original in feeling, pace and plot), but not particularly original.The production values are a slight step up from II, about as good as Endgame, and almost up to the original's standards.Conor McLeod has reclaimed something of his humanity - imagining himself to be the last immortal on earth, but of course, he is wrong. Sorcerer Kane, who has stolen the magic of one of McLeod's former teachers, is hunting his head. McLeod has adopted a child and is about to fall in love again, the last thing he needs is an attack by an enemy who has no corporeal body.The film is entirely predictable, and is nothing more than a fan film. So what? It's harmless entertainment with some very pretty scenes from Scotland and some other gorgeous landscapes, and, if you don't expect much, you might just have a good time with it.",0,"[enjoy, film, original, highlander, one, series, really, stand, test, time, endgame, join, stand, head, shoulder, others, artistic, merit, originality, still, like, others, well, enough, also, like, much, malign, christopher, lambert, odd, actor, sure, far, hollywood, norm, appearance, style, accent, nothing, original, understand, understated, style, might, see, guy, serious, talent, read, statement, resonate, otherwise, feel, free, move, without, reading, rating, good, unger, good, van, peebles, campy, hell, alternate, absurdist, humor, menace, script, ok, certainly, less, grandiose, mindless, ii, closer, original, feel, pace, plot, particularly, production, value, slight, step, ii, good, endgame, almost, original, mcleod, reclaim, something, humanity, imagine, last, immortal, earth, ...]","[just, to, be, up-front, about, i enjoy these films, original, highlander, was, only, in, the series, really stands, the test, of, time, endgame, has now joined, it, in, stands, head and shoulders, above, the others, for, artistic merit, originality, still, i, liked, the others, well enough, i, also, like, much maligned, christopher lambert, he, is, an odd actor, to, be, sure, far, from, the hollywood norm, in, appearance, style and accent, he, is nothing, if, not original, once, you, understand, his, understated, style, you, might just see, that, the guy, has, some serious talent, read, on if, these statements, resonate, with, you, otherwise, feel, free, to, move, on without, reading, rating, this review.lambert, is, good, unger, is, good, van peebles, is, campy, as, hell, alternating, between, absurdist humor, menacing poseur-ship.the script, is ok, certainly less grandiose and more mindless, than, ii, closer, to, ...]",-0.09574861982038368,0.05320457740263529,1,1,3
Hot Fuzz (2007) - IMDb, One of the Most Brilliant Comedies I've Ever Seen,jzappa30,April/2007,10/10,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",1,"[hot, fuzz, satirizes, american, action, film, way, american, satire, would, edgar, wright, simon, pegg, simply, spoof, plot, thread, car, chase, know, small, detail, hollywood, formula, exemplify, continuous, reference, scene, point, break, keanu, reef, fire, gun, sky, anger, scene, bad, boy, ii, martin, lawrence, circle, track, shot, say, get, real, tackle, less, clear, characteristic, hollywood, also, perfectly, portray, people, talk, awesome, scene, action, movie, hilariously, nick, frost, film, brilliantly, precise, tune, american, mainstream, action, irony, film, take, place, serenely, beautiful, english, countryside, way, film, important, american, see, delf, deeply, conscious, social, mannerism, english, parody, timid, insular, english, village, life, perhaps, brilliant, ...]","[hot fuzz, satirizes, american action films, in, a way, that, an american satire, would, not, edgar wright and simon pegg, do, not simply, spoof, the plot threads, the car chases, they, know, the smaller details, of, hollywood, formula, as, they, exemplify, with, its continuous references, to, the scene, in, point break, where, keanu reeves fires his gun, into, the sky, in, anger and the scene, in, bad boys, ii, where, martin lawrence, in, circling tracking, shot, says, s, just got, real, not only do, they, tackle, those less clear characteristics, of, hollywood, they, also perfectly portray, people, talk, about, awesome scenes, in, action movies, hilariously, by, nick frost, the film, is, brilliantly, in, precise tune, with, the american mainstream action, adventure.the irony, in, this film, is, that, it, takes, place, in, the serenely beautiful english countryside, in, some ways, the film, is, very important, for, americans, to, see, it, delves, very deeply, into, the conscious social mannerisms, of, the english, parodies, the timid insular english village life, ...]",-0.14113911476498,0.011741396599794056,1,1,1

How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) - IMDb, A touching finale to a wonderful series,dupregalaxy3,January/2019,9/10,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic.

In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007) - IMDb, Who is Uwe Boll and what did we do to him to deserve this?,matt-soulliere11,January/2008,2/10,"I went into this expecting a bad movie, you could say I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.Now I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.If you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did.

Inception (2010) - IMDb, Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah.,clipturnity22,August/2010,9/10,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.

Inception (2010) - IMDb, Good idea lost in the noise,Carl_Tait25,July/2010,5/10,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination.

Inspector Gadget (1999) - IMDb, Inspector Gadget gets thrown out the window and Disney takes over,vogonford29,May/2006,1/10,"I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget. First thing- in the film, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the awesome book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.Another thing is that it's too much ""Good Guy v. Bad Guy"" in the film. It's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. Also, Gadget never should have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.But if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The movie was too serious, too overdone, had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny.Tip for those who haven't seen it: NEVER see it. EVER.

Ip Man (2008) - IMDb, Powerhouse performance by Donnie Yen,DouglasQuaid14,December/2008,8/10,"Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine, although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man (or Ye Wen, as they were shouting in the seats next to mine) he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side, carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas, at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again, moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.I'm not going to delve deeper into plot details. The basic stuff is already outlined above, and I also feel the historical accuracy of certain events depicted can be debated. That's a bit of a moot point, though, since most people will watch this for the action scenes. Nobody will be disappointed. Donnie kicks twelve kinds of ass in this movie, and it is all accompanied by some of the meanest sound design I've ever heard. Every one of his rapid punches can be felt as he pummels the poor bastards in his way with the Ip Man-style of martial arts (imdb won't let me spell out the name for some reason). The final bout is epic,but for me it was one scene about halfway through that got my heart beating faster. It involves Donnie, ten Japanese karate practitioners and some of the most furious fighting I've ever seen on screen. You can really sense the anger of his character in this scene. Great stuff.The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. It totally lacks the vintage over-the-top-aesthetics of Donnie Yen's films of the 80's and 90's, but for some people that's a good thing. I personally think this is his finest performance to date.

Jason X (2001) - IMDb, I admit a guilty pleasure of mine I never thought this is a terrible film,ivo-cobra824,September/2017,6/10,"SPOILER: Uber Jason in outer space I don't mind the film and it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I saw this movie in the video store 11 years ago when I was in high school I saw the VHS cover of the film and I saw it on DVD. So finally I got this film on Blu-ray disc just finish it watching it today and I must say it is not a bad film I like it a lot. Like I said it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know a lot of people hate this film I don't. I think is MILES way better then Jason Goes to Hell and Miles way better movie then Hellraiser: Bloodline that was in outer space this movie is just better.7.years ago when I become a fan of Supernatural I heard that Jared Padalecki will be in the reboot Friday the 13th movie I rushed to see this movie. I watch Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, the (2009) reboot and this film Jason X and yes I like it.I thought this movie will copy Alien and Aliens but it didn't copy any of those films it was solid and it was original it had his own story. I didn't thought this movie was bad I thought it was an interesting story that had a good action and a good slasher kills.Lexa Doig was an alright as the final girl tough it was a science fiction film it was still good and I will still watching it. Lexa Doig was in The Tracker with Casper Van Dien and I liked that action film I haven't seen in a while.Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.Lexa Doig worked in facility Crystal Lake in which they capture Jason Voorhees but he kills everyone and escapes but Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig) freeze him and her self in 2008. The year is now 2455 and a new crew members on a ship unfroze those two only too realize they unfroze Jason Voorhees unstoppable killing machine. Now a new group of soldiers tries to defeat Jason who later becomes Uber Jason.Lisa Ryder was great, sexy and really hot as Kay-Em 14 I liked her, she really kicked Jason's ass and she shot him to death ha ha.So it is scary? No. Is it a good movie? No. Is it fun? VERY.I also forgot this movie is reference to Demolition Man (1993) my all time favorite futuristic action Stallone film.

Jason X (2001) - IMDb," Big, dumb and stoopid, but fun",ExpendableMan13,January/2005,5/10,"Let's face it, if you're going to rent one of the later movies in a slasher movie series, you'd be an idiot to expect high art. The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle-draggingly, ball-scratchingly cretinous 'horror' series of all time AND it's set in space doesn't exactly suggest that this'll be an all-time classic, but it's a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless.Okay, the plot is so thin even a slight breeze would make it disintegrate and the horror element is practically non-existent but then Jason movies abandoned that long ago in favour of just providing dumb escapism with inventive and bloody death scenes, which this film certainly provides. People are sliced in half, impaled on large spikes, blown up, one poor woman even getting her head dunked in liquid nitrogen and shattered on a desk, but the characters are so one-dimensional and it's so cheesy you're more likely to laugh than scream. And I defy you to watch the scene when Jason gets transformed into 'Uber Jason' for the first time and not have a colossal grin traverse your face. There's even a later scene which pokes fun at the earlier movie's clichés with a hilarious ""beating one camper to death with the other"" sequence.This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, ""it's just fun.""

Jeepers Creepers III (2017) - IMDb, 14 years for this??? MY THEATER WAS LAUGHING THE ENTIRE TIME!,darthMisaskernew27,September/2017,1/10,"What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen.

Jonah Hex (2010) - IMDb, A Complete Guide to a User Ratings Travesty,witster1819,October/2010,6/10,"Sometimes I wonder if people that reviewed this film actually watched it, or if they gave it a chance, not like second glancing at it because they're cooking dinner at the same time.Jonah Hex is an entertaining little movie based upon the DC Comic Book character. To be honest, I've never read the comic, had little expectations coming in, and wouldn't have gone to see this in the theater. This genre is admittedly, 'right up my alley'. Usually I check some ratings on here before renting movies so that I avoid the flops. Thankfully, I didn't look on IMDb until AFTER I had already rented it. So when I looked at IMDb's 4.6 user rating AFTER renting it, but BEFORE watching it; my expectations were lowered even further, and I nearly put off watching it, again. Nevertheless, it was due the next day and I popped it in the DVD player when the other-half went to bed(too bad - she would have liked it). I have a good sound system and a nice TV - both made this action/western/fantasy even better.Let's take a look at some of the films on IMDb with similar user ratings - specifically some of the worst films that I have ever seen/wasted my time and money on.Ready to Wear(Pret-A-Porter)4.8 Actually rated higher than Jonah Hex. This was two hours I will NEVER get back. A terribly boring movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.King Solomon's Mines 4.6 Tied with Jonah Hex. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. A literal walk out of the theater. And I know what you're thinking. I talked about giving movies a chance earlier, but I revisited KSM years later, and it still remains the worst film I've ever seen in my lifetime, 1 and a half times. Toys 4.6 Enough said.Jonah Hex' style is true to the comic book theme. The opening of the film is excellent, and gives us a good foundation for an entertaining storyline. John Malkovich is ALWAYS a good adversary/bad guy, and Josh Brolin IS Jonah Hex. Megan Foxes' role is small, and she serves every purpose, much like a smoking hot Bond girl. Her Body alone makes this film worth 4.6.But, Jonah Hex is much more. It's interesting, it's action packed, and it's well-paced. Now, is it believable? No. What comic book based film is? Is it Oscar worthy? No. Will it appear on any legitimate 2010 Top Ten lists? No. Jonah Hex is the pure definition of a popcorn flick. Not just one that rare movie watchers might over-rate(It's no nine or ten), and one that critics will annihilate, but one that is sure to surprise many who give it a chance. It's worth the rental - especially if you have a TV and sound system that can give you a near theater experience. I like some of the subtle touches to this movie, and Malkovich and Brolin really help the cause.58/100You'll like it if you liked: Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Timecop.",1,"[sometimes, wonder, people, review, film, actually, watch, give, chance, like, second, glance, cooking, dinner, hex, entertain, little, movie, base, upon, dc, comic, book, character, honest, never, read, comic, little, expectation, come, would, go, see, theater, genre, admittedly, alley, usually, check, rating, rent, movie, avoid, flop, thankfully, look, imdb, already, rent, look, imdb, user, rating, rent, watch, expectation, lower, even, nearly, put, watch, nevertheless, due, next, day, popped, dvd, player, go, bed, bad, would, like, good, sound, system, nice, tv, make, even, us, take, look, film, imdb, similar, user, rating, specifically, bad, film, ever, time, money, wear, actually, rat, high, jonah, ...]","[sometimes i wonder, if, people, that, reviewed, this film, actually watched, it, if, they, gave, it a chance, not, like, second glancing, at, it, because, they, are, cooking, dinner, at, the same time.jonah hex, is, entertaining, little movie, based, upon, the dc, comic book character, to, be, honest, i, have never read, the comic, had, little expectations, coming, in, would not have gone, to, see, this in, the theater, this genre, is, admittedly, right, up, my alley, usually i, check, some ratings, on, here, before, renting, movies, so that, i avoid, the flops, thankfully, i, did not look, on, imdb, until after, i, had already rented, it, so when, i, looked, at, imdb, 4.6 user rating, after, renting, it, before, watching, it, my expectations, were lowered, even further, i, nearly put, off, watching, it, again, nevertheless, it, was due, the next day, i, popped, it, ...]",0.02590998244912144,0.171654107499303,0,2,3
Jonah Hex (2010) - IMDb, Potential for great summer popcorn flick wasted,cadillac2021,June/2010,5/10,"I wasn't really expecting much out of this film. And I thought that it coming out the same weekend as Toy Story 3 was pretty laughable. But it seemed like fun, so I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly, it turned out pretty much how I expected, and it's no wonder there was such little advertisement paid to this film. Jonah Hex is pretty straightforward in it's story. Jonah Hex witnessed his family die at the hands of John Turnbull. Unfortunately, for Hex, Turnbull died mysteriously in a hotel fire...or did he. Turns out Tunrbull is still alive and a danger to the US. Now, Jonah must get his revenge and save the US.A lot of people have compared this film to The Wild Wild West. Thankfully, this is not that film. Granted, it's not all that grounded in reality (actually, it's not grounded in reality much at all), but there's no giant walking spiders or head slicing, flying discs. The action here is pretty ridiculous and outrageous, but at the same is fun. It helps that Josh Brolin, as the titular Jonah Hex, is pretty damn cool. He plays off Dirty Harry pretty well, with only a few one liners and a pretty well drawn out character. In fact, I would say that if they ever do a remake of Dirty Harry, I would vote for Brolin to take up the reins. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the cast is not as good. John Malkovich plays Turnbull lazily. Sure, he's not as hammy as he could have been, which I am grateful for, but I can't help but feel that he isn't the least bit interested in what he is doing. And with the kind of character he's supposed to be, there should be more passion, but it's sadly missing. As for the third big name, Megan Fox does what she does best and looks hot in some slutty western dresses. For a film like this, I guess you can't ask much more from her.The action is obviously where this film is at, and it mostly delivers. It's far from the biggest action film this summer, but there are some pretty outrageous and entertaining pieces, like the Gatling gun-mounted horse and the dynamite gun scenes known from the trailer. And when there isn't action going on, Brolin saves the film. Besides the action, he is the best thing here. I would also even argue that the film does a good job translating the comic book style. While it could have been much better, it could also have been a lot worse. I guess I can at least be thankful for that.Suffice to say, I pretty much got what I thought I would get out of the film: a cool Josh Brolin, a hot Megan Fox, a wooden John Malkovich, and a lot of crazy action. Was I satisfied? I suppose. It was a decent way to kill about an hour and a half. Would I run out to the theater for this? Nah. If you really care about the ticket price and your time, I would just wait to rent it on DVD.",0,"[really, expect, much, film, thought, come, weekend, toy, story, pretty, laughable, seem, like, fun, thought, would, give, try, sadly, turn, pretty, much, expect, wonder, little, advertisement, paid, film, jonah, hex, pretty, straightforward, story, jonah, hex, witness, family, die, hand, john, turnbull, unfortunately, hex, turnbull, die, mysteriously, hotel, fire, turn, tunrbull, still, alive, danger, u, jonah, must, get, revenge, save, lot, people, compare, film, wild, wild, west, thankfully, film, grant, ground, reality, actually, ground, reality, much, giant, walk, spider, head, slice, fly, disc, action, pretty, ridiculous, outrageous, fun, help, josh, brolin, titular, jonah, hex, pretty, damn, cool, play, dirty, harry, pretty, ...]","[i, was not really expecting, much, out of, this film, i, thought, that, it, coming, the, same weekend, as, toy story, was, pretty laughable, it, seemed, like, fun, so i, thought, i, would give, it, try, sadly, it, turned, out, pretty much, how, i, expected, it, is, no wonder, was, such little advertisement, paid, to, this film, jonah hex, is, pretty straightforward, in, it, is story, jonah hex, witnessed, his family die, at, the hands, of, john turnbull, unfortunately, for, hex, turnbull, died, mysteriously, in, a hotel, did, he, turns, out, tunrbull, is, still alive, a danger, to, the us, now, jonah, must get, his revenge, save, the us.a lot, of, people, have compared, this film, to, the wild wild west, thankfully, is, not, that, film, granted, it, is, not, all that, grounded, in, reality, actually, it, ...]",-0.11488778094758974,0.13914560320750244,1,1,3

Kangaroo Jack (2003) - IMDb, Not as bad as everybody says it is- it's about average,patrick_dunne23,November/2005,5/10,"Let's get to the point. Kangaroo Jack is necessarily the worst film of all time, but neither is it the greatest. It's not even close. What it is though is fairly humorous, though usually silly.The story is a bit good at parts, but far-fetched at others. Charlie and Louis were best friends ever since childhood, after one saved another from drowning. One of their fathers was a gangster or something, and the two are sent with a job to deliver the money to some other dude. The story isn't quite a bad one, and does take a little twist.

Kaththi (2014) - IMDb, Blind to facts and logic,dreambigwin29,October/2014,2/10,"I was encouraged to watch the movie and many friends recommended it on the lines that if you liked Ramana, you will like this movie. But for some reason, I found the script totally lacking common sense and showed the lack of depth in knowledge of the writers of the plot. The plot is centered around the struggles of villagers versus MNC(Corporate). The word MNC and corporate are overused in the movie, that it left such a bad taste to me. Maybe it would have been nice if someone explained Economics 101 to the writers of this movie. My distaste for the movie stems from the simplicity with which commercial Tamil movie makers want to handle the script - black versus white. Heroes versus villains. A lot of movies these days have transcended such stereotyping showing all possible greys, but this movie should have been made like 40 years ago, and then possibly it would have deserved all the praise. In fact a basic fact check would disprove the premise of the whole movie. Farmers earn more when they sell their land to acquiring corporates. It is simple market mechanism. If a beverage company dries out a river, it just means, we people are lazy and like to indulge in carbonated drinks. As long as there is demand, you cannot villify the firms for it. On a sidenote, both Pepsi and Coke follow sustainable practices for most part, and I would encourage the writers to check about it. And the farmers are none the poorer for selling their land to acquiring firms. See all the farmers driving BMWs in Gurgaon. And please for Godsake, companies do not collude as shown in the movie. If you want to switch off the real world and enjoy a masala cum emotional movie, then you will probably like this one.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) - IMDb, No story to the movie,l8apex3228,October/2003,1/10,"Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.Unfortunately, Kill Bill was not interesting, nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically, the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hit-list of people from which to extract revenge.The way she extracts revenge is to engage in hand-to-hand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course, the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.I think Luci Liu (sp?) is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon, she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists - and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20, 30, 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.Then, she battles the ""board leader"", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood, as you'd expect from the director (I won't try to spell his name). But, you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait, my mistake, you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.After the Liu's character is killed, #3 is checked off and the movie ends.There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art, but do not make a movie.I have no interest in ""Part 2"" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.Two thumbs down.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) - IMDb, The Better Half,slokes24,September/2004,8/10,"It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in ""Volume 1."" Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of ""Kill Bill,"" released only a few months before ""Vol. 2"" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. ""Vol. 1"" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.""Vol. 2"" is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from ""Vol. 1"" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in ""Vol. 2"" he doesn't go as overboard as he does in ""Vol. 1."" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its ""Vol. 1""-style comic-book treatment. Throughout ""Vol. 2"" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. ""Vol. 1"" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of ""Vol. 2.""This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of ""Vol. 2"" tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in ""Vol. 1"" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of ""Vol. 1"" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says ""Kiddo."" You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is slow-moving, and needs ""Vol. 1"" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their ""unfinished business"" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) - IMDb," Kill Bill? Should be Kill Tarantino, more like...",Rob_Taylor30,April/2004,1/10,"Awful, boring, slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.Now, I admit, I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed, but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's non-stop action has been replaced almost entirely by non-stop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact, I'll coin a new term here - dire-logue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition, and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibber-jabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then, instead of getting on with the movie, the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!Nor do the pointlessly long (and in fact, just pointless) extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example, we learn that Bud (Bill's brother) lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser - a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more, including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies, right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes, it only serves to remind you that, whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood, she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei (the sensei) that he taught her the ""hand of death"" trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride, but by Elle using a Black Mamba (we know it's a Black Mamba because, as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor, Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake). Elle isn't killed by the Bride, but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill, who is killed by the Bride (after endless boring dialogue about superheroes) in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing ""final encounter"" scenes I've ever witnessed.The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra half-hour that they had to cut from the first film, padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing, KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant, interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are - due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However, KB2 is little more than self-indulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those ""I liked so-and-so, but the sequel was rubbish"" type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills, I'd say he needs to be evicted from post-production facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in.",0,"[awful, boring, slow, tedious, word, spring, mind, recall, sit, kill, bill, vol, kindest, word, think, choice, word, would, crap, rubbish, plain, admit, expect, kb, vol, rehash, expect, something, dissimilar, vol, sound, music, texas, chainsaw, massacre, first, film, action, replace, almost, entirely, dialogue, particular, good, dialogue, either, fact, coin, new, term, film, litter, film, requires, certain, amount, exposition, even, mystic, claptrap, like, matrix, movie, kb, vol, take, claptrap, new, level, make, matrix, movie, look, positively, spartan, term, bad, thing, chatter, total, utter, meaninglessness, drone, character, make, point, verbally, instead, get, movie, character, force, belabour, point, practically, scream, shut, hell, get, pointlessly, ...]","[awful, boring, slow and, tedious are, just, a few words, that, spring, to, mind, when, i recall, having, to, sit, kill bill, vol, those are, the kindest words, i can think, of, a few more choice words, would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.now, i admit, i, was not expecting, kb vol, rehashed, i, did expect something, not too dissimilar, from, vol, is, to, as, the sound, of, music, is, to, the texas, chainsaw massacre, the first film, non-stop action, has been replaced, almost entirely, by, non-stop dialogue, not particular good, dialogue, either, in, fact, i, will coin, a new term, here, dire-logue, the film, is littered, with, it, any film, requires, a certain amount, of, exposition, even mystic claptrap, like that in, the matrix movies, kb vol, takes, claptrap, to, a new level, makes, the matrix movies, look, positively spartan, in, terms, of, jibber-jabber, the worst thing, about, the chatter, in, is, total and, utter meaninglessness, of, most, of, it, it just drones, on, on, ...]",-0.01312894858623392,0.03781712361258739,1,1,1

But I was at my video store, and I was still attracted by the cover of the movie so I decided to rent it again. And this is after I read the positive comments. I felt so different from the last time I watched this movie. I was enjoying it. I thought ""Man! I was stupid!"" This movie was funny. I didn't like Rob Shnieder at the beginning, but I liked him this time. He was playing his role as the comic relief guy right this time. I like Jean-Claude Van-Damme. I think he's a cool actor. The only reason why the movie haters don't like him is because of his accent. I think his accent's cool, After this, I'm gonna start sending my comments to Van Damme movies. The action sequences were awesome. The chases, fight scenes, gun battles, all great. I loved the direction by Tsui Hark. His camera angles, the zoom-ins, the stobes, tracers, slow-motion, it was so cool. I was like: ""Woa! That was cool that zoom in on the inside of electronics and stuff!"" This movie was so much fun.

Knockin' on Heaven's Door (1997) - IMDb, Low-level chick-flick,yoshware29,April/2006,4/10,"This movie is not as good as it seems. The story is catchy maybe for 12-year-olds. I watched it in the movie theater at that very age and liked it. Just a few weeks ago i tried to watch it again and it was so terrible, i couldn't even finish it. Knocking on heavens door is full of stereotypes. The two goons, who are hired to get the car back act terribly and fulfill every cliché in the book.

Not that those movies are the best ones ever made. But i think all those movies are better than 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' and don't deserve the same rating. That's why i would give it a 4.

Logan (2017) - IMDb, Disappointment,jherrick-6-99133610,March/2017,4/10,"I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.""Logan"" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called ""The Westchester Incident"", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the ""Westchester Incident""), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the ""R"" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the ""R"" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of ""Deadpool"" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie ""Jurassic Park"", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For ""Deadpool"" it works. You can't do ""Deadpool"" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who ""Deadpool"" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated ""upgrades"" now don't make a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like ""Logan"" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, ""Logan"" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of ""The Walking Dead"" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else.",0,"[look, logan, alien, franchise, basically, give, gigantic, middle, finger, everything, come, destroys, everything, movie, proceed, day, future, past, accomplish, dofp, mutant, kind, destroyed, heroic, action, logan, survive, accord, film, logan, get, kill, year, later, anyways, say, one, big, theme, logan, disappointment, agree, disappointed, film, logan, annoyingly, low, information, thrown, terribly, depress, future, without, whole, lot, explain, get, watch, kept, wait, scene, thing, laid, audience, never, come, best, get, vague, reference, something, call, westchester, incident, reference, fleeting, barely, caught, also, another, part, near, end, main, villain, claim, something, lack, new, mutant, born, striker, son, think, clear, plus, dude, last, name, actually, ...]","[i look, at, logan, as, alien, of, the x-men franchise, it, basically gives, a gigantic middle finger, to, everything, came, before, it, it, destroys everything, the movie, proceeded, it, days, of, future, past, accomplished, in, dofp, all of, mutant kind, are about, to, be destroyed, by, the heroic actions, of, logan himself, they, survive, then, according, to, the film, logan, they, get, killed, off, a few years, later, it, has been said, that, of, the big themes, of, logan, was disappointment, i agree, i, was very disappointed, in, is, annoyingly low, on, information, we, are thrown, into, this terribly depressing future, without, a whole lot, of, explaining, as to, how, we, got, here, as, i, watched, i, kept waiting, for, a scene, where, things, were laid, down, for, the audience, it, never came, the best we, got were, a few vague references, here, there, was something called, the westchester incident, ...]",-0.06355305153515377,0.13087937958823306,1,1,3
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - IMDb, Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,ivo-cobra83,October/2015,10/10,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it!

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - IMDb, Superficial action movie that lacks depth,jethrotroll-3080729,May/2015,4/10,"I'm not completely sure what I was expecting from Fury Road, but it was more than this. This is the latest example of Hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit. It's mindless, repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichés.One of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used, and in this the movie mostly delivers. You have the high-powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. There's battle vehicles equipped with spikes, rigs with counter-balanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles, and there's even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make KISS jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment. And of course, each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship. And it's put to good use.However, once you get past the eye candy, you realize there's nothing else to it. The story is weak. The characters are weaker. And the acting is the worst. The movie never drew me in. Not even close. Whenever the movie 'tried' to add depth and be dramatic, it was painful and embarrassing to watch. The scene where Furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene I've ever watched. And it says something when the most interesting character is Nux, a relentless slave/warrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help Max and Furiosa in their quest. Of course, one of Immortan Joe's wives falls for him, representing one of the many poorly executed clichés this movie is riddled with.I can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is, to a point. This one, however, is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired.

Max Steel (2016) - IMDb, Yikes What a Piece,bkrauser-81-31106416,October/2016,3/10,"Make no mistake, Max Steel, the Mattel toy property, turned Cartoon Network staple, turned full length movie has become the worst reviewed wide-release film of 2016. After a single weekend, the movie has garnered a staggering Metascore of 26, and a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Those are scores usually reserved for direct to DVD video game adaptations and the occasional Pauly Shore movie. I'll admit with so many metrics stacked up against it, my interest both as a critic and a connoisseur of junk cinema was piqued. I wanted to hate this movie; I came in with the expectation that this movie was a special kind of crappy. But alas it's just the regular kind of crappy.The plot of Max Steel promises the adventures of a middle-America teenager named Max (played by perennial kids-TV bit-player Ben Winchell) and his alien companion named Steel. Due to Max's seemingly inexplicable ability to conjure energy on a molecular level, Steel acts as a symbiotic techno-parasite consuming it with relative safety. In return, Steel (voiced by Josh Brener) enhances Max's physical abilities and protects him with a laser spewing bio- tech suit. Little does Max know that his new friendship with his alien buddy upsets a certain celestial balance, that holds the future of our world in the hands of a sinister enemy.The plot promises these things but in an election year, we should all be wary of false promises by now. While watching Max Steel I was less concerned about the fate of the world than the fate of those involved in this project and made the mistake of taking it seriously. The film co-stars award nominated actors Maria Bello and Andy Garcia whose natural gravitas threatens to give Max Steel more weight than your average Smallville (2001-2011) knockoff. I understand that veteran actors need to eat but most actors should draw the line when asked to put on a half-assembled Power Rangers outfit.The film itself is a cheap, shabby, impotent mess that tries oh so hard to ape the grungy self-serious aesthetic from recent superhero fare. But instead of finding a balance between pretension and moment- focused excess, the camera diddles through colorless scenes that look like they were shot through a layer of cellophane and Vaseline. This of course is when we get exteriors of antique pickup trucks chugging through amber-waved back-roads. When it comes to the heavy climaxes, the movie seems poised to give us the same blighted industrial zones we've seen in everything from low-budget horror movies to late-period Steven Seagal flicks. Only this time it's lighted like a neighborhood Zap- Zone to give the film's target audience (mainly toddlers and their misguided gamgams) the desire to whip out their video games.It's all so genuinely and quite unpleasantly sad to see a movie like Max Steel. Watching bloated, intelligence insulting, big-budget fare fall flat can give anyone a sudden jolt of schadenfreude. Yet watching something whose only real crime is being too big for its britches, well it's just not that much fun. The film and its makers are trying to mimic a certain style, a certain flow, a certain spirit yet it simply have none of the right tools to do so. So they patched this puppy up with as much exposition, flashbacks and Josh Brener inspired wisecracks to trick you into thinking it was all worth it. But it's not, it's really, really not.Max Steel is like going to the zoo, visiting the tiger exhibit and seeing a tiger born and raised in captivity. Many people arguably worked their best on this film, but because their best is inspired by the limited cultural echo chamber of comic books, blockbuster movies and Halo, we get a movie that lazes about, the fierceness in its eyes completely absent.",0,"[make, mistake, max, steel, mattel, toy, property, turn, cartoon, network, staple, turn, full, length, movie, become, bad, review, film, single, weekend, movie, garner, stagger, metascore, rotten, tomato, score, usually, reserve, direct, dvd, video, game, adaptation, occasional, pauly, shore, movie, admit, many, metric, stack, interest, critic, connoisseur, junk, cinema, pique, want, hate, movie, come, expectation, movie, special, kind, crappy, ala, regular, kind, plot, max, steel, promise, adventure, teenager, name, max, played, perennial, ben, winchell, alien, companion, name, steel, due, max, seemingly, inexplicable, ability, conjure, energy, molecular, level, steel, act, symbiotic, consume, relative, safety, return, steel, voiced, josh, brener, enhances, max, physical, ...]","[make, no mistake, max steel, the mattel toy property, turned, cartoon network staple, turned, full length movie, has become, worst reviewed, wide-release film, of, after, a single weekend, the movie, has garnered, a staggering metascore, of, on, rotten tomatoes, those are scores, usually reserved, for, direct, to, dvd, video game adaptations and the occasional pauly shore movie, i, will admit, with, so many metrics, stacked, up against, it, my, interest, both as, a critic, a connoisseur, of, junk cinema, was piqued, i, wanted, to, hate, this movie, i, came, in with, the expectation, that, this movie, was, a special kind, of, crappy, it, is, just, the regular kind, of, crappy.the plot, of, max steel, promises, the adventures, of, a middle-america teenager, named, max, played, by, perennial kids-tv bit-player ben winchell, his, alien companion, named, steel, due, to, max, seemingly inexplicable ability, to, conjure, energy, on, a molecular level, steel acts, as, a symbiotic techno-parasite consuming it, with, relative safety, in, return, steel, voiced, by, josh brener, enhances, max, ...]",0.010959968991706124,0.0340512662679214,0,1,1

His Triple Role : Farmer, Doctor, Magician were all new get ups for Vijay and has he done well with these characters? 100% YES! Right From The ""Mersal Arasan"" To The Flashback Sequences Of The Leader Farmer, Thalapathy excels! As Usual, he excels in his romance, dance, comedy and attitudes throughout the film which keep the audience entertained in each way. The Story by Baahubali Writer ""Vijayendra Prasad"" was quite different even though it had some elements of an action Marsala film but Atlee's direction of the film keep it unique.AR Rahman's BGM is merattal masss! He proves his Oscar winning award in Mersal, songs such as Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Neethanae bring out the audience a real taste of Mersal!SJ Surya as a villain plays his role neatly (look out for his dialogues/scenes in the second half) a perfect suit for the movie - Stylish.Also, actors such as Vadivelu and Sathyaraj stand out not just for their comedy but for their highly rated emotional scenes which Atlee narrates well. Vadivelu fanatics will leave the cinema with smiles on their faces:)Heroines play their role superbly in each of Vijays Characters and so do other actors such as Sathyan, Kovai Sarala, Vikram Vedha's ""Cheta"" etc.GK Vishnu has fantastic cinematography for a debut, thanks to Atlee for giving him an opportunity to see how perfectly he can do his job! Visuals in Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Many of the magician scenes excel, thalapathy is captured spot on!Ruben the editor has done his job well, with neat cuts and editing to keep the movie at a smooth pace.What can I say, a pure Thalapathy Vijay entertainer with high emotional/ mass scenes which will impress the audience of all type.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) - IMDb, Quite Possibly the Worst Movie in the Realm of Known Existence,chr1sberg16,December/2001,1/10,"I made the mistake of going to see this movie, first show, first day, in the theater, in 1997 when it was released. The first movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was fun. I expected more with the 2nd. The only thing I knew about it going in was that James Remar was replacing Christopher Lambert as Rayden, which I was upset about, but I thought Remar would do a good job.Boy, was I wrong. The whole cast, even Robin Shou, who was decent in the 1st, and great in Beverly Hills Ninja, can't seem to act his way out of a paper bag in this one.*** Mega Spoilers, Cause You Shouldn't See This Movie Anyway ***The big mistake the writers made with this movie, was trying to incorporate all of the characters, even the hidden ones, from not just Mortal Kombat 2, but Mortal Kombat 3 as well. (The plot is taken from the MK3 video game). MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3, a trio, a team, and their ""teacher"" Raiden. And only 2 bad guys (Goro, Shang Tsung). In MK2, we have a virtual plethora of heroes and baddies.Heroes (8): Liu Kang/Rayden/Kitana/Sonya/Jax/Johnny Cage/Nightwolf/Sub ZeroBaddies (14): Shao Kahn, Shinnok, Sindel, Motaro, Jade, Sheeva, Cyrax, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Ermac, Rain, Baraka, Smoke, and Mileena.Yeah, I thought that was a lot too. All of these characters have lines and/or fight scenes too. This doesn't even include the characters from the games that are mentioned, but not shown. A bunch of these baddies (and even some heroes) die or just leave, never to return, in about a minute after they appear. For instance, here's the plot of some of the sub characters:Rain: Says hi, gets thrown into a fiery pit.Sub Zero: Shows up, says hi, fights and kills botty Smoke, tells Liu Kang ""you are not ready"", then disappears, never to be heard from again. Smoke: Killed within a 2 minutes by aforementioned Sub Zero.Baraka: er.. I think you see him.. once.Mileena: Shows up, attacks Sonya, somehow dies from a bonk on the head.Scorpion: Shows up, fights Sub-Zero, kidnaps Kitana, disappears.Johnny Cage: Shows up, says hi, Shao Kahn breaks his neck a good minute into the movie. Sheeva: Has a few lines early, Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.Those are just some examples. On top of these character issues, the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take. There are literally *tons* of continuity and placement errors. A few quick examples, all from the same 10 minute stretch:Rayden leaves Sonya, and tells her to find her buddy Jaz, then to head to ""The Temple of the Elder Gods"". Of course, after she finds Jax, she immediately knows where it is.When we first meet His Jaxness himself, he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax. We pan away with his fist somehow stuck in a wall with a good inch of space around it. We pan back a few seconds later, and his entire arm is stuck in the wall.Sonya gets into a muddy fan-service fight with Mileena. After a muddy battle, and a split scene later, all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned.During aforementioned Muddy Fan-Service fight, Sonya gets thrown into a rock. This big rock, about 10 times the size of her, waggles and moves a bit with her weight falling on it. Again, those are just some examples, but they're *rampant* in the movie. As for the plot, well, the idea and premise is interesting, but they delve way too deep into it. It would have been better if they kept it superficial, the way they did in the first movie. But, no, they had to try to explain everything: life, existence, the tournament, and why the toast always lands butter side down.The result of all this atrocity is a corny, poorly directed, aterribly written, underbudgeted (looks like most of the stuff *I* could have pulled off with my home computer) nightmare that's worth buying solely to laugh at. 0/10",0,"[make, mistake, go, see, movie, first, show, first, day, theater, release, first, movie, bad, great, fun, expect, thing, knew, go, james, remar, replace, christopher, lambert, rayden, upset, thought, remar, would, good, wrong, whole, cast, even, robin, shou, decent, great, beverly, hill, ninja, seem, act, way, paper, bag, one, mega, spoiler, see, movie, anyway, big, mistake, writer, make, movie, try, incorporate, character, even, hidden, one, mortal, kombat, mortal, kombat, well, plot, take, video, game, survive, multiple, hero, trio, team, teacher, raiden, bad, guy, goro, shang, tsung, virtual, plethora, hero, liu, zerobaddies, shao, kahn, shinnok, sindel, motaro, jade, sheeva, cyrax, scorpion, noob, ...]","[i, made, the mistake, of, going, to, see, this movie, first show, first day, in, the theater, in, when, it, was released, the first movie, was, not bad, it, was, not great, it, was fun, i, expected, more, with, the only thing i, knew, about, it, going, was, that, james, remar was replacing, christopher lambert, as, rayden, i was upset, about, i, thought, remar, would do, good, was i, wrong, the whole cast, even robin shou, was, decent, in, the 1st, great, in, beverly hills, ninja, cannot seem, to, act, his way, out of, a paper bag, in, mega spoilers, because, you, should not see, this movie, anyway, big, mistake, the writers, made, with, this movie, was trying, to, incorporate, all of, the characters, even, hidden, ones, from, not, just mortal kombat, mortal kombat, as, well, the plot, is taken, from, the mk3 video game, survived, multiple heroes, because, were, ...]",0.043024973673269275,-0.02697785594716594,0,0,0
Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion (1997) - IMDb, Simply stunning!,Fiss29,October/1999,10/10,"Finally, after long last, I have managed to watch the End of Evangelion. It was worth any wait.  Those not familiar with the series will have no clue what's happening, so you should at least watch the first 24 episodes.  End of Eva takes place as an alternative to the last 25 and 26th episodes.  It may sound confusing, but trust me, if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything makes sense...even if not right away.The final Angel has been killed.  The 'hero' of the story, Shinji Ikari, now regrets doing it, as he was the only person who seemed to ever like him for who he was.  But there is no time to lament on personal demons, as the shadowy puppet masters in SEELE have set the final stage of their plan in motion.The dreaded Third Impact.  What's even more surprising is that the entire series shows one, giant plan to actually SPEED ALONG the Third Impact, as it could lead Humanity to it's next evolutionary step.  And so, Humanity will now rely on a weak savior who may or may not lead humanity to it's oblivion.  A hero who must first fight his own inner dragons, and come to terms with life, and love from himself and from others. As a response to the public outcry that the last 2 episodes were someone strange and had no ""Mecha Combat"", the End of Eva has enough of both combat, AND philosophical scenes.  A strange, but wonderful mix. 
Asuka's fight against 9 Evas is absolutely the most STUNNING visual fight sequence I have ever seen.  The energy and awesome scope of the battle is impossible to convey through words alone.Though Asuka's character is as flawed as Shinji's, she finds redemption in this movie.  Again, an amazing testimony of the Human Spirit and our will to live.  The emotional impact of this movie is also quite amazing.  It brings reality and the mind to question, and asks us if being individuals is better than being a whole.  Is life just a dream, and can we ever be Gods of our own Reality?  Those who have watched the last two episodes of the series will see instances where the movie and episodes combine and compliment each other. Finally, the animation is wonderful.  Creepy and breathtaking.  Powerfully deep, but also amazing on the physical conflict level as well.  This movie is EASILY a match for Akira and is an instant classic. 
Watch it with an open mind, and be prepared to be stunned. Be ready to question yourself.  Be ready to use your mind in ways you may have not before.

There is also never an explanation to how Shinji has the significance he has in the end, although the idea of the Destined One is so powerful that even though he's never described that way I imagine people will take it for that.The movie is basically set up as the final two episodes of the series. The first episode is very action packed, which is not at all like the series. In fact, one of the things I liked about the series was that it eschewed the mecha-battle-of-the-week approach in favor of studying the psychology of its characters. But in the first half of the movie there is mainly action and little psychology or character development.The second half basically does exactly what the final two, famously unsatisfying episodes of the series did; it goes into Shinji's head and talks about his fears. I appreciate that the writer was aiming for something more than a sci-fi fantasy tale, and that his real goal was to explore loneliness and unhappiness. But it is possible to do both, and offering half a story and then wandering into the mind is not the way to do that.But of course, that's exactly what happened in the series. I hoped it would be different, because the director said much of what happened at the series end had to do with time and money constraints, but that now looks to be a lie. This is what he wanted to do. And some people love it.

Ninja Scroll (1993) - IMDb, The leash has come off.,lost-in-limbo28,November/2006,8/10,"Jubei, a rouge samurai who's wandering the land becomes involved unwillingly in the battle between an evil group of supernatural demon warriors known as the Eight Devils of Kimon and the country's government. After a town was wiped out overnight by a plague, so the eight devils could get in to get perform a certain mysterious task. Jubei soon is joined by a poisonous female samurai known as Kagero to find out the Devils' business is in this town, after one of them wipe out her ninja team and nearly her if it hadn't been for Jubei. He also encounters someone of the past, who he thought that he already had killed. So I've gone back to my roots when anime was a childhood favourite of mine, but this one isn't for kids. I loved this flick when I was in my early teens, so watching it now was such a nostalgia trip and surprisingly it still holds up exceptionally well. The popular worldwide hit ""Ninja Scroll"", which was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (who brought us the excellent ""Vampire Hunter D"") paves way for a maturely slick, extremely violent and intensely erotic outlook. Everything about it comes thick and fast. It frenetically exploits the blood sprayed violence like a running tap, but still never loses that beautifully tender edge that seeps into many of the situations. The compelling premise isn't a mind-bender, although a bit jaded, but its simple origins only enhance the taut lay out and poignantly dark array of blisteringly out-there conflicts. It's surprising in it developments and you're left amazed by the film's personality and unique world that's created. It vividly captures the period of this atmospheric world. They're such an imaginatively diverse barrage of dynamic characters, with the likes of the rock-build demon to the hunchback whose hump are a wasp nest and a snake lady who can actually shed her skin. This gave it a real eastern mythological state and only proves that the bad guys had the most fun. The story might feel like its there only to set up one spirited confrontation after another and really it is. But the story-telling element is effectively defined, as most of the main players get enough time to mould there own back story and present their significance to where it could be heading. Jubei makes a cool anti-hero and Kagero fits nicely along side him. The skillful animation has class, agility, originality and distinguishing details making its way into these stunningly pristine visuals. An aggressively crisp sounding FX makes the experience a whole lot more impressive with such a wide range and the oriental twang found in the eerily mystic music score makes this presentation more brooding in its blinding passion and checkered emotion. Kawajiri faced no restrictions here, and was free to come up with an illustriously innovative and majestic anime piece that works in every frame. ""Ninja Scroll"" is more highly involving than you would believe.

Oldboy (2003) - IMDb, If only we were all living in Asia....,bur_00719,December/2007,10/10,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema.

Oldboy (2003) - IMDb, A rather disappointing effort,schnofel29,September/2004,5/10,"Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped, but you know the story, so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself, the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment, I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks (full of bad pathos) and explanations. To keep the audience interested, we get gruesome scenes of murder, self-mutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked, these scenes are well done, but serve no greater purpose. It's all a so-what comic extravaganza.Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment, courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today. I liked (among other things) the infamous hallway scene, the actors, the fight with the bodyguard, the revelation of the Secret and the sequence of Oh Dae-su leaving his bad self behind at the end.

Omkara (2006) - IMDb, Excellent piece of craftsmanship,suraj-av28,July/2006,9/10,"I caught the first screening of Omkara, and I must say that I am astounded. Vishal Bharadwaj had previously carved a niche for himself in the industry, with the likes of Makdee and Maqbool, but Omkara puts him in a league of his own. It is an exquisite work of art, with each person putting in their best. Everyone knows Omkara to be an adaptation of Othello, and I frankly expected Omkara to be just that. At best, I thought it would be Vishal's homage to Shakespeare. I was terribly wrong. Omkara is a poem in itself. Every aspect of the movie has the dedication and tenacity of the director stamped on it (considering he has handled direction, dialogues, screenplay, music, and even sung a song). The beauty of Omkara lies not in its portrayal of Othello, but the fact that it uses Othello as a platform to weave an intricate tale of love, obsession, treachery and tragedy. Yes, Omkara is an adaptation of Othello, but that is not the strength of the movie. The real strength of the movie lies in the performances of all the characters, and the gripping narrative. From the word go, Omkara has you by the crotch (pardon the usage), and lets go only after the last credits have rolled off. Vishal's Omkara (Othello) is the chieftain of a band of outlaws in a semi-lawless rural area in Uttar Pradesh. His brother and right hand man is Langda Tyagi (Iago), named so for his limp. Another prominent figure in this gang is Keshu Firangi(Michael Cassio), the only member to have a college education. Omkara is in love with the bewitchingly beautiful Dolly (Desdemona), and she with him. At her behest, he and his gang interrupt her wedding and bring her to his village. In the village, Langda's wife Indu(Emilia) takes Dolly under her wing, becoming companion and friend. When Omkara appoints Keshu as the youth leader of the gang, Langda (who anticipated the post) feels jealous and overlooked, and seeks revenge by convincing Omkara that Dolly is having an affair with Keshu behind his back. For most part the story is the same as that of Othello, with just the background of each character adapted to suit the Indian temperament. Also, the language used a mix of Hindi and Bhojpuri, which adds to the aesthetics of the movie.Ajay Devgan as Omkara ascends to new heights of emoting, using his eyes to convey so much more than he could ever say. The obsessive lover, the ruthless gang leader, a man eaten up by his inferiority complex and the doubts borne thereof, Ajay lives every moment of his character. Viveik Oberoi is seen after a bit of a hiatus, and does considerably well. As the childlike Keshu, with his boyish grin and charm, you can't help liking him, and feeling sorry for him. Kareena Kapoor has always been an actress to reckon with in my books, since her 'Refugee' 'Chameli', and 'Dev' days, and proves her mettle as the devoted and loving Dolly. Quality work from a largely underrated actress, proving that she's a lot more than the glam girl she often portrays. The surprise of the pack was Bipasha, who does a considerably extended 'special' appearance and ample justice to her role as Billo, Keshu's love interest. Neseeruddin Shah as the overlord Bhaisaab, is a treat to watch. To say anything more would take away from the essence of his performance. Konkana Sen-Sharma as the simple, yet shrewd Indu is brilliance personified. With her natural accent and looks, she suits the role to a T. You instantly see in Indu a strong and loving woman. Be it as Dolly's friend, Lagda's wife, or as a bhabhi to the younger members of the gang, Konkana has the role down pat. Particularly endearing is her 'kheiin', akin to an 'arre'. Each of these actors has portrayed their characters faultlessly, and no other actor could have done them better. Yet they all pale in comparison to Saif Ali Khan, as the cunning, devious, and calculating Langda Tyagi. This man is simply too good an actor. Sly and manipulative, his persona exudes pure evil,without even the stereotype evil laugh. His eyes strike a fear that resonates deep in your soul, and even hours after the movie is over,Langda is the character you keep thinking of, and is easily the pick of the lot. If Saif deserved a National Award for HUM TUM, then an award for this is a no-brainer.Hats off to all the cast and crew members of Omkara, and to Vishal Bharadwaj, for creating this masterpiece of contemporary Hindi cinema.SurajPS- Watch out for the expletives used freely in the movie.

On Deadly Ground (1994) - IMDb, Grossly over-indulgent vanity piece,CuriosityKilledShawn17,October/2000,4/10,"At the height of his fame Seagal was allowed to direct this monstrosity about evil Texas oil Aegis company polluting Alaska. With no prior experience in directing Steve stampeded his way into this movie with as much subtlety as a brick in the face. Originally called 'Spirit Warrior' and hoping to cast loads of English baddies (among them Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons) the film is a horrid example of far too much creative control given to one man too blinkered by his own agenda to bother giving us anything resembling decent storytelling.There is nothing significant or exceptional about Seagal's direction. Nor is the action very well done. It's cut too lazily and not shot for maximum viewing clarity. But what reeks about the story is that some big oil magnate called Michael Jennings (a completely hammy Michael Caine) wants to build a really shoddy oil rig in Alaska made out of dodgy parts because the rights to the land are about to revert back to the Eskimos after 30 years of non-use. So why wait 30 years to build the bloody thing?Seagal plays Forrest Taft, an oil rig fireman who suddenly develops a conscience and is promptly eliminated from the payroll by way of being blown up. Only he is rescue by the Eskimos and, this is where the film just goes insane, goes on a spiritual journey in which he wrestles bears and turns into eagles and stuff. I mean, what the hell is all that about??? Don't even get me started on the scene where he makes a fully-grown hard-ass redneck cry in a bar full of similar stereotypes when the philosophy touches his soul. Then he gets his old self back together and sets about righting all the wrongs of Aegis Oil and saving the environment by littering it with dead bad guys. Jennings hires a bunch of mercenaries (including R. Lee Ermey and Billy Bob Thornton) to take out Taft but of course they all prove to be useless since Taft is revealed to be an ex-CIA Agent (oh dear God..)Nothing much really happens apart from shooting and dying and Seagal beating up nameless extras. We've seen all of this before and it's no different this time round.I do appreciate his environmentally friendly attitude but it could have made it a little less obvious and campy. Seagal's tacked on speech at the end originally ran for 30 minutes (Jeezuz sufferin') but Warner finally stepped in and said a big no-no.

Here's where I think the Thai audience have the last laugh with their recent censor ratings. Ong Bak 3 is rating an 18+ there, and over here, we got by with an NC16. Not so bad I thought to myself, until the first 5 minutes saw a number of badly executed butchering of the film, that I balked. We should have gone M18 to be in line, and perhaps those torture scenes would have survived the censors scissors. But no thanks to the distributors who decided to try and make this film appeal to a larger Jaa audience. Surprisingly though the more violent moments later on in the film were left untouched, scenes that I felt were violent enough with the likes of a decapitation, and face/head stomp to warrant an axe under the NC16 rating. But I guess I'm not a censor.Anyway, action fans may feel a little bit disappointed with this installment which ran just over 90 minutes. For the first hour we only have limited battle sequences involving our hero, so savour whatever you can in his fight for survival against hordes of weapon wielding enemies who have the unfair advantage of strength in numbers against a badly beaten (just came off those numerous fights from Ong Bak 2) Tien. Totally broken and just as he's about to be executed, Tien gets saved by the bell and brought back to the village of Kana Khone, where another fight ensues involving his new rescuers against Rajasena's assassins.Then it's a good plod onto the hour mark, where Tien goes through a reincarnation of sorts, involving body wraps, mystical chants, Master Bua (Nirut Sirichanya) turning to monkhood and imparting pearls of wisdom, the rehabilitation of body, mind and soul, time for romance with Pim (Primorata Dejudom) his pillar of strength, discussions of karmic philosophy and the circle of life. Tien has to unlearn what he has learnt, and basically has to snap all the bones of his body back in place before he can practice martial arts again, which brings us a bearded Jaa and a training montage in a tree, under water, showing off a lean though scarred body, and is that a little paunch I see as well?So while Tien takes a breather of sorts for his transformation, the duty of keeping the action junkies entertained fell on Dan Chupong's shoulders, as his very short supporting role as the Crow Ghost got expanded here, with his motivation fully revealed. His character soars to evil heights here, taking over the mantle as chief villain, and allowing Chupong to reintroduce himself as an action star to be reckoned with in his own right. Those who have seen Born to Fight and Dynamite Warrior will know what he is capable of, and I really salute him for daring to take on a negative role just to spar with Jaa on screen.But what a letdown when they finally get together to do battle. Overall I found their sparring quite weak compared to what had been done earlier in the film involving other exponents, and the finishing blow was quite a letdown. Already the number of fights and spars here were limited to begin with, one even involving the architecture of the mind (sorry, Inception still fresh), and this one just didn't pack enough oomph. It's built up to be something like Tien being a Moses to lead his people, captive by the Crow to be slaves getting constantly whipped, back to their promised land, and hey, he even comes with a staff that got dropped off after a magical moment got executed, in time for fisticuffs.The only positive coming out from this new Tien, is his new fighting ability. Tien is now more graceful, thanks to the fusion of dance to his moves, and the many moments when this parallel that dance brings to the table, got heavy emphasis, meshing what we usually think of as effeminate, to giving that suppleness to the more masculine moves involving elbows and knees to bone-crunching effect. This to-the-point moves were not forgotten of course, and come in the form of very economical, sometimes comical, but always simple, strikes involving forearms and a rigid body trained to be as hard as steel. I still miss those drunken fists moves from the earlier film, and the insanely choreographed finale battles then, which this one had tried to emulate, only to be a pale shadow of its former's glory.Comedian Petchtai Wongkamiao provided some comic relief in a film that took itself quite seriously, and I think in light of some of the themes that were handled in quite a verbose manner, this was much appreciated. Ong Bak 3 straddles martial arts and philosophy very openly and tried to strike a fair balance between the two, but alas it came off as quite a schizophrenic film very much like True Legend in spirit. I hope the Ong Bak 2 and 3 episodes don't tank Tony Jaa's career, because I'm sure he has enough in reserve to wow audiences once again, should the right story come along that pushes his physical boundaries.",1,"[pick, directly, last, left, cliffhanger, end, part, opening, credit, montage, quickly, jog, memory, see, tien, get, systematically, broken, many, minion, nemesis, lord, rajasena, sarunyoo, wongkrachang, think, thai, audience, last, laugh, recent, censor, rating, ong, bak, rating, get, bad, thought, first, minute, saw, number, badly, execute, butchering, film, balk, go, line, perhaps, torture, scene, would, survive, censor, scissors, thanks, distributor, decide, try, make, film, appeal, large, jaa, audience, surprisingly, though, violent, moment, later, film, left, untouched, scene, felt, violent, enough, like, decapitation, stomp, warrant, axe, rating, guess, action, fan, may, feel, little, bit, disappointed, installment, ran, minute, first, hour, limited, battle, ...]","[picking, up, directly where, we, last left, off in that, cliffhanger, ending, in, part, after, an opening credits, montage, to, quickly jog, our memory, we, see, how, tien gets systematically broken, down, by, the many minions, of, his nemesis lord rajasena, sarunyoo wongkrachang, here, where, i, think, the thai audience, have, the last laugh, with, their recent censor ratings, ong bak, is rating, over, here, we, got, by with, not, so bad i, thought, to, myself, until, first, 5 minutes, saw, a number, of, badly executed, butchering, of, the film, that, i, balked, we, should have gone, to, be, in, line, perhaps, those torture scenes, would have survived, the censors scissors, no thanks, to, the distributors, decided, to, try, make, this film appeal, to, a larger jaa audience, surprisingly, though, the more violent moments, later, on in, the film, were left, untouched, scenes, that, i, felt were, violent, enough, with, the likes, of, a decapitation, face/head stomp, to, ...]",-0.08405267371916327,-2.4631657734969427e-05,1,1,1

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) - IMDb, Depp for Emperor?,eak-127,November/2005,10/10,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure.

I watched it stone cold sober, alone, in my living room.Amazingly I just gave an Uwe Boll film 8 stars, I know, I can't believe it myself.

I laughed throughout the entire movie, with the exception of about seven jokes which didn't make sense or just didn't work. But it doesn't matter that these seven jokes failed because the movie is an endless stream of jokes, sight gags, bikini clad cult members, machine gun battles, and bad taste in the vein of John Waters/Troma Films earliest efforts.It's too bad Uwe Boll got himself involved in a petty internet pi**ing contest over this film. I think had he just been modest, kept his mouth shut, and let the film speak for itself it may have been a minor success. The old Hollywood saying about there being ""no such thing as bad publicity"" doesn't work for you when all you get is BAD PUBLICITY. That said, the only real problems with the film are the low budget production values and a few of the minor performances, but even those problems just add to the humor of this film. The plot actually made sense.The actors played it straight without being too zany too often. And the jokes, although in bad taste and definitely not for everybody, were never so mean spirited that I was turned off by them.I think Uwe Boll knew what he was doing with this picture.

Neither of those statements are saying particularly much, but to say the least, this movie is actually worth watching.

Primeval (2007) - IMDb," Nothing great, but above average horror flick",godjunior7112,January/2007,6/10,"I admit it, I have a soft spot for monster movies. Maybe it's the kid in me who watched all the old ""creature features"" at a young age, or maybe it's the fact that no one has really made a serious monster movie since...well, you tell me. That being said, ""Primeval"" is no work of genius, and like most mainstream films, is loaded with clichéd moments that we've seen in better movies. However, when compared to the films that pass for horror today, this one has surprising bite (no pun intended) at certain moments. The main complaint here seems to be the misleading advertising campaign of the film, hyping it up as a tale of serial killer in rural Africa. Of course, the actual story details an American news team (the brooding male leader, the hot female sidekick, and of course, the token black guy who serves mostly as comic relief) traveling to the war-torn Burundi to film and hopefully capture Gustave, an enormous crocodile who has eaten hundreds of people. Naturally, things go wrong, and the river soon runs red. An interesting aspect of the movie is the inclusion of a warlord in the plot, adding a second threat to the protagonists (Gustave is, of course, their first threat). This risky move sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, but I applaud the filmmakers for trying something new at least. What really redeems the film however are a few key scenes that are surprisingly atmospheric (something most modern horror films have forgotten), well edited, and increasingly suspenseful. Without giving too much away, the croc itself is better than one may expect from this kind of a movie. The cast does what they can with a strictly average script, yet for the most part, manage to elicit some interest and sympathy. The final act is a bit of a disappointment, but by that point, it's already been a fun, exciting ride, and one doesn't really care. In short, ""Primeval"" is strictly what many of us go to the movies for: popcorn entertainment. I myself had originally gone to see ""Pan's Labyrinth"" but as the shows were sold out, my friends and I eventually decided to give ""Primeval"" a go. I wasn't dazzled, but then again, I wasn't expecting to be. It's simply fun, escapist entertainment, and despite what any film snob will tell you, there's nothing wrong with that.

The special effects are weak. All could have been better. This movie could be compared to Anaconda, but replace the snake with a killer crocodile. Swap out South America and see Africa instead. Unlike Anaconda, Primeval makes a social statement about the political unrest in Africa. In the back drop of filming a crocodile documentary, political unrest and murder is happening all around them. Where this movie suffers is the pacing. It starts out slow and isn't even interesting until the crocodile appears. Once the crocodile appears, that's really all you may care to see. Unfortunately, the special effects are too obvious and the crocodile acts fake and looks fake. It's only at this point that the movie even gets up to the quality of Anaconda which also had fake looking effects.Orlando Jones as Steven Johnson brings a welcome light touch of humor to an otherwise serious movie.

Ra.One (2011) - IMDb, A confused mishmash of formulae,ashu-modi9,November/2011,1/10,"From the time that the credits roll on to the screen (Thanks to Shahenshah Amitabh, Superstar Rajnikanth and hugs to Sanjay Dutt & Priyanka Chopra), one gets the feeling that the movie is an indulgence in the exercise of 'I scratch your back and you scratch mine' and not the self proclaimed revolution in Hindi film making.It is a confused mishmash of the same formulae that have been used in the Hindi film industry for all these years with some early 90s style Hollywood special effects thrown in. Somebody needs to tell the director Anubhav Sinha and the producer/actor Shah Rukh Khan that one cannot and should not try to please all the people in the audience, else the end result is exactly what they served: a movie that feels forced and staleStory: By now, all who are remotely interested in this movie know about the story. It is the weakest link in the entire setup. The entire writer's union (even SRK has been credited with contributing to something that amounts to nothing) couldn't decide whether this needs to be a sci-fi, superhero, romance, children or an action flick. Some of the outstanding moments (scenes where I nearly stood outside the theater)are: 1. A press conference at the start where the audience is dumb as it believes the crap that Ms. Reddy dishes out about technology 2. The moment when the antagonist steps out of the game - no explanation on how the game developed an intelligence on its own or how it could move into the physical world in a suit that obviously does not have even a millionth of the processing power or storage capacity needed for such a complicated being to function 3. The superhero's entry - again, no idea how it came into being in the physical world. And how the hell did Ms. Reddy (who seems more like a marketing executive) figure out what the lead game designer / team leader SRK could not4. How was Kareena able to keep her husband's death a secret from the neighbours in India? These days when even a burp is reported on the Facebook and/or Tweeted around the world, it seems highly unlikely5. Why the hell did the robot have to run along the side of the train when running on the top would have been the fastest way to the motorman's cabin?Frankly, the entire story leaves a lot to be desiredInfluences: 1. Poster inspired from Batman Begins 2. The story inspired from Judgement Day (robot saves mother and son from another robot), The Last Action Hero (characters from imaginary world stepping out into the real world), Tron (gaming world characters vs real world characters), Kalicharan (father dies, someone replaces him to protect family), Iron Man (the concept of H.A.R.T. is the same as the arc reactor), Millennium Man (a robot learning about emotions) 3. Scenes inspired from Spiderman series, Batman series, Terminator series, Iron Man series, Rajni's Robot, whew 4.

Rage (2014) - IMDb, Ten stars for possibly worst film of this century,manvanmusic29,April/2014,10/10,"This movie is fantastic - honestly, it's shooting up my 'So Bad It's Good' charts with a bullet (badoom-tish!) I have no idea why Danny Glover's character is in it. Feels like he phoned someone and said, 'I need fifty bucks and I'm free on Sunday. Anything going down?' Peter Stormare, whilst generally good fun in crap flicks, is so utterly miscast it's borderline genius. What's that accent Pete? I can't tell if you mean to sound like a Canadian with palsy, or you were battling some gastro/intestinal thing, but damn bro, you sound pretty crook. Cage with his helmet or hair or whatever that thing is on his head is brilliant. Injecting heartfelt emotion into scenes that don't need it, screaming in new and obscure ways, playing it cool after trashing 20 corpses and fifty cars, he just injects a well-needed shake-up on traditional acting. Let's be completely inappropriate and flip between ham and wood - hello Oscar! Script has the bones of something in it, but the director has taken a leaf out of Cage's book here - let's not polish the turd, but rough it up some.

Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - IMDb, Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s,jazzest19,July/2004,3/10,"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo).

Ran (1985) - IMDb, The Best Film based on one of Shakespeare Best Works. This Masterpiece is recommended for anyone that loves movies . Truly one of the Greatest Films of all time!,Loving_Silence19,August/2010,10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",1,"[akira, kurosawa, ran, base, one, shakespeare, great, work, king, lear, film, proudly, stand, along, classic, seven, samurai, yojimbo, roshomon, sanjuro, hidden, fortress, master, art, filmmaking, one, film, epic, battle, scene, quite, like, kurosawa, recognize, expensive, film, ever, make, akira, kurosawa, time, japan, expensive, film, ever, age, still, show, us, one, best, movie, age, lord, head, ichimonji, family, decides, retire, pas, power, taro, eldest, three, son, however, banish, saburo, young, one, dare, speak, truth, soon, former, lord, chase, away, castle, son, becomes, mad, understands, one, son, try, kill, three, brother, fight, control, kingdom, lust, power, grows, every, day, four, army, face, ...]","[akira kurosawa, ran, is based, of, shakespeare, greatest works, king, lear, the film, proudly stands, along with, his, other classic such, as, yojimbo, roshomon, sanjuro, hidden, fortress, he, is, a master, in, the art, of, filmmaking, no one, can film, an epic battle scene, quite, like, kurosawa, is recognized, as, the most expensive film, ever made, by, akira kurosawa, it, was, at that, time, japan, most expensive film, ever, being, at, the age, of, he, still showed, us, he, is, of, best, in, the business.this movie, is, about, an aging lord, head, of, the ichimonji family, decides, to, retire, to, pass, the power, to, taro, eldest, of, his three sons, he, will however have, to, banish, saburo, youngest, dared, to, speak, the truth, to, him, soon, the former lord, is chased, away, from, the castles, of, his sons, becomes, mad, when, he, understands, ...]",-0.15841184624822857,-0.003461843403205811,1,1,1
Ran (1985) - IMDb, Not as great as I thought it would be,FilmOtaku3,June/2005,5/10,"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. ""Ran"" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that ""Ran"" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word ""awe"") Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, ""Ran"" gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",0,"[realize, practically, heresy, film, world, criticize, kurosawa, film, much, less, downright, dislike, would, like, precede, review, say, absolutely, love, every, kurosawa, film, see, ran, kurosawa, film, base, somewhat, shakespeare, king, lear, story, elderly, emperor, hand, kingdom, old, three, son, old, middle, son, fan, say, deserve, etc, young, speaks, mind, subject, incur, wrath, father, ultimately, banishment, area, meanwhile, two, old, son, make, mess, thing, kingdom, lead, war, fratricide, dismissal, father, even, attempt, murder, none, motif, noble, honorable, avarice, power, motivate, lead, tragedy, knew, go, light, story, mean, anyone, read, familiar, lear, story, pretty, much, slog, though, wonderfully, told, ran, pretty, much, ...]","[realizing, that, it, is, practically heresy, in, the film world, to, criticize, a kurosawa film, much, less downright dislike it, i, would like, to, precede, my review, by, saying, that, i, have absolutely loved, every kurosawa film i, have seen, , until, now, ran, kurosawa, 1985 film, based, somewhat, on, shakespeare, king lear, is, the story, of, an elderly emperor, hands, down, his kingdom, to, oldest, of, his three sons, while, oldest, middle son fan, over, each other, saying, that, they, are, not deserving, it, is, youngest, speaks, his mind, about, the subject, incurring, the wrath, of, his father, ultimately, banishment, from, the area, meanwhile, the two older sons, are making, a mess, of, things, with, the kingdom, leading, to, wars, fratricide and the dismissal, of, their father, even attempting, his murder, none, of, their motives, are, noble or honorable, only avarice, power motivate them, leading, to, tragedy, for, into, i, ...]",-0.17974002310915405,0.10396029831859749,1,1,3

Rise: Blood Hunter (2007) - IMDb," Disappointing, confusing & predictable",kane478222,October/2007,3/10,"I saw the trailer of this a while back and thought it could be one of those sleeper hits, as it had a relatively good premise and I've always been intrigued by vampire films, so when I saw it on the shelves I thought I'd give it a go.As the film was overall a disappointment for me, I won't put any spoilers in this review. I will say however that from the outset, the sequence of events are disjointed and make for confusing viewing. The film tries to be too clever throughout and ultimately ends up being hard to follow. For a vampire film, it doesn't really give much background to the whole vampire genre as most do and adds to the confusion as to who is who and what is what. Apart from Lucy Liu's character, there is no back story or build up to the antagonists, everything just happens randomly, which makes it an effort to keep track of things.As for the acting, I find it a shame that Lucy Liu continues to make films that don't really challenge her. She spends most of this film looking either in distress or moody, oh and naked. Having seen her in Kill Bill and her earlier turns in Ally McBeal, Rise & Ecks vs Sever really don't do her justice as an actress. The vampire contingent here are pretty poor too, with James D'Arcy playing a poor mans version of every other bad vampire we've seen before (notably Stephen Dorff in Blade).

RoboCop 3 (1993) - IMDb, I don't care what people say...,gothamite273,December/2004,7/10,"I don't care what people say. I think this film is cool. It is flawed, but it is still far cooler than RoboCop 2 (or RoboCrap as I like to call it). The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors, and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman: Forever' (another film unique in its own franchise). **SPOILERS**The plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis, RoboCop is seriously p***ed off. The plot is simple, but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy one-liners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimp-mobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robo-fans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences, and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However, I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line, throwing their badges at an OCP executive, and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film (if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films). **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!**It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gun/flamethrower attachment (it attached to his hand) to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However, I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely, and the flying scene, however fake, is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.**END SPOILERS** Overall, RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom One-Hundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in (usually) have strong political satire in them, then this is the film for you. 6/10.",1,"[care, people, say, think, film, cool, flaw, still, far, cooler, robocop, robocrap, like, call, drama, film, make, unique, amongst, predecessor, much, better, like, forever, another, film, unique, franchise, plot, see, ocp, go, ahead, delta, city, hire, mercenary, group, call, arehab, people, home, rehabilitation, camp, police, hate, idea, stray, bullet, hit, officer, ann, lewis, robocop, seriously, plot, simple, superior, simplicity, campy, gag, let, film, one, occasion, thing, like, robocop, commandeer, sergeant, reid, deal, drag, queen, prostitute, thing, fume, television, screen, would, say, reason, lot, people, hate, film, passion, another, reason, repel, little, political, satire, fact, main, character, try, beat, system, good, ...]","[i, do, not care, people say, i, think, this film, is, cool, it, is, flawed, it, is, still far cooler, than, robocop, robocrap, as, i, like, to, call, it, the drama, in, this film, makes, it, unique, amongst, its predecessors, it, is, much better, than, the likes, of, batman, forever ', another film, unique, in, its own franchise, spoilers**the plot, sees, ocp, going, ahead, with, delta city, they, hire, a mercenary group, called, arehab, to, escort, ', the people, from, their homes, into, rehabilitation camps, the police, hate, this idea, once, a stray bullet hits, officer ann, lewis, robocop, is seriously p***ed, off, the plot, is, simple, it, is, superior, in, its simplicity, it, is, the campy one-liners, gags, let, this film, down, on, more, than, one occasion, things, like, robocop, commandeering, a pimp-mobile, sergeant, reid having, ...]",-0.16538999017259737,0.1174930490862194,1,1,3

Roja (1992) - IMDb, First part of Mani Ratnam's political trilogy,hprill12,April/2004,8/10,"This is the first movie of what was to become director Mani Ratnam's ""political trilogy"" (""Bombay"" and ""Dil Se"" being the movies to follow). While not quite as accomplished as the later movies, he develops a very simple story of a young married couple, the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a well-rounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses:The love relationship between the two main characters is credible and well-handled; the struggle of the individual citizen vs. government authorities and individual desires vs. the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely (the scene where the Colonel tells Roja that ""everyone is happy"" is simply chilling), and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well, even if it seems sometimes that Rishi Kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people.The only problem that I have with this movie are a small handful of scenes in which Indian patriotism is showcased in what I felt was a rather blunt manner (but then, coming from a different country, I may lack some essential cultural background to understand it).Apart from this one quibble I think it's a good movie that you should really see, especially I've you've seen Mani Ratnam's other films. Acting is solid, especially from Pankaj Kapoor as the terrorist leader, but also from Arvind Swamy as Rishi (except perhaps when he goes into patriotic overdrive).

Rush (2013) - IMDb, Well worth the wait!,robertjenkins45615,September/2013,9/10,"The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian ""professor"" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, ""Bubbles"" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film ""feels"" like it's happening in the 70's.

Sarfarosh (1999) - IMDb, flawless...,raghavbansal23,February/2005,9/10,"this is a real gem of a movie...it's right there among the top 5 of my favorite Hindi movies. the movie hooks you right away and the plot never slackens throughout...coupled with realistic treatment, it makes the movie an instant favorite. also the subject is very different - the proxy war waged by Pakistan's ISI. refreshingly and reassuringly, there are no corrupt cops in the movie! Aamir Khan as ACP Rathore is superb. he brings alive a cop's passion and determination to cleanse the system of criminals. the action sequences are played out very realistically. Mukesh Rishi as ACP's right hand man is just brilliant! This actor usually plays only ""black"" characters - this surely added to the impact of his performance (for me, at least).

Satya (1998) - IMDb, In my books Satya along with Sholay jointly hold the position for the best Hindi movie ever made.,sanamlove22,October/2004,10/10,"Ramgopal Varma's hard hitting film on the Bombay Underworld. This movie is a classic from scene one to the climax. When you see this movie you will see history in the making. A hard hitting story of a person from nowhere , Satya. How he joins the underworld gang led by bhiku mhatre. This movie gives one message hard 'CRIME NEVER PAYS'.The scene where chander(snehal dabi) tells a joke, the scene where bhiku mhatre satya vidya and pyaari go for a dinner, the scene where yedda scares the music director romu sagar, the theatre scene, the climax, all these scenes will go down in the history of Indian cinema as classic scenes. Urmila Matondkar as Satya's Girlfriend and Shefali Chaaya as bhiku mhatre's wife are excellent. J.D.Chakravarthi is brilliant as Satya. Manoj Bajpai gives an excellent and award winning performance as bhiku mhatre.He has managed to make the character of bhiku mhatre an immortal one like late amjad khan did for gabbar singh. Govind Namdeo is brilliant as Bhau. Co-script writer saurabh shukla is superb as kallu mama.It is so nice to see that first time writers saurabh shukla & anurag kashyap wrote such a brilliant script. A special mention must be made of the best cameo since rajesh khanna's cameo in andaz, by paresh raawal as commissioner of police.Satya was supposed to be made as a songless film but co-producer Bharat Shah felt that no distributor will buy the film and it will be too tense. Music director Vishal Bharadwaj and lyricist Gulzar were roped in to provide the music for this film and they did a brilliant work. The song 'Sapne Main milti hai' and 'kallu mamma' are too good.

Serenity (2005) - IMDb, Extraordinary,manosdvd17,August/2005,10/10,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though, don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself.

Serenity (2005) - IMDb, Disappointing,sunraider2,October/2005,5/10,"I first became interested in FIREFLY, the series, and SERENITY, through the early trailers shown back in May. AFter seeing the trailer I rented the series, loved it, and since purchasing the DVD have seen it many times. I really looked forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameos,while Kaylee, Wash, and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River, but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are, for the most part, absent. The plot is action-heavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the ""two-by-two, hands-of-blue"" creeps to show up but they never did. Finally, the operative's bizarre about-face at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more.

Sherlock Jr. (1924) - IMDb, Through the Movie Screen,imogensara_smith13,September/2006,9/10,"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of filmor is it the film-like nature of dreams? As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a filmbut this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choiceand a responsibilityto clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?",1,"[buster, keaton, surreal, movie, sprang, insistence, logic, realism, tribute, cinema, inspire, stage, magic, trick, remember, vaudeville, career, dazzle, original, movie, also, one, least, formally, perfect, paradox, belong, naturally, look, glass, work, examines, nature, nature, dream, buster, told, origin, film, lay, desire, use, certain, illusionary, stunt, like, bewildering, dive, living, assistant, stomach, learn, secret, child, firmly, believe, impossible, cartoon, gag, acceptable, feature, film, could, include, make, occur, dream, also, odd, think, since, seems, say, impossible, thing, happen, rule, refuse, break, create, outer, film, real, inner, film, real, keaton, show, film, enables, illusion, distortion, reality, filmmaker, clearly, delineate, fact, fantasy, one, scene, ...]","[buster keaton, most surreal movie, sprang, from, his insistence, on, logic and realism, his tribute, to, cinema was inspired, by, stage magic tricks he, remembered, from, his vaudeville career, his, most dazzling and, original movie, is, also, of, his, least formally perfect, all these paradoxes, belong, naturally, to, through, the looking glass, work, examines, the dream-like nature, of, filmor, is, it the film-like nature, of, dreams, as, buster, told, it, the origin, of, the film, lay, in, his desire, to, use, certain illusionary stunts, like, the bewildering dive, through, a living assistant, stomach, which, he, had learned, the secret, of as, a child, he, firmly believed, that, impossible, cartoon, gags, were, not acceptable, in, feature films, so, he, could only include, them, by making, them, occur, in, a dream, is, also, a film-within-a-film, is, odd, when, you, think, about, it, since, he, seems, to, be saying is, that, impossible things, can happen, in, ...]",-0.11305401544717444,-0.004581937225512086,1,1,1

Singularity (2017) - IMDb, what a waste of time,conyo4,November/2017,3/10,"Such a disappointment. I am a fan of sci-fi movies, and here I was ""wow, human vs machine apocalypse!"". Boy, was I wrong. Plot has so many holes it's hard to describe, and sometimes you wonder if perhaps the editing moved scenes around (so ending scenes are in the middle of the movie etc). Lines are cliché (""you have to let me go"" and such). Acting is sub-par (main character only uses two facial expressions - normal face and bulging eyes face).

Well... Wants to eat him.Along the way, a few thousand rounds are spilled out of big shiny guns, and stuff gets blown up.

Skinwalkers (2006) - IMDb, Worthless werewolf crap.,BA_Harrison30,November/2007,1/10,"Horror fans are idiots.Or at least I think that is what the makers of Skinwalkers must believe. A werewolf movie which makes up its own rules and mythology in order to suit its weak story, and tries to detract from its sheer awfulness with some shoot-outs and a couple of babes, this absolute mess shows complete contempt for fans of the genre.Throwing the audience straight into the middle of a storyline from the outset, director James Isaac confuses viewers for the first 20 minutes, and then spends the rest of the movie's running time dishing up sub-standard lycanthropic hogwash.In Skinwalkers, according to an ancient prophecy (that old chestnut), a half-breed boy will have the power to end the werewolf curse once he reaches the age of thirteen (at the stroke of midnight, of course!). With only days to go before his all important thirteenth birthday, a gang of nasty lycanthropes, who wish to remain as they are, set out to kill the boy. Fortunately for the lad, a small group of good werewolves, who wish to become human again, risk their lives to protect him.Had the makers of this wolfish cack bothered to dish up some decent looking beasts, or perhaps some effective gore, then maybe I would be a little more forgiving.

Skyline (2010) - IMDb," Not awful, certainly not expected...",sionyn_rhys13,November/2010,7/10,"They drop from the sky with no warning. They do seemingly inexplicable things. They are capable of things that defy human experience. And we see it from the perspective of people we have no real connection to.My first thoughts were something like, ""How are K-Fed and Bobby Brown gonna save the planet?"" Turns out, I need not have wondered.What I thought the movie did very well was tell the story from the point of view of a handful of people that have no extraordinary attributes whatsoever. Disaster movies tend to have characters able to overcome improbable odds to somehow accomplish some measure of victory for Earth and/or humanity. Not so in Skyline. We have an apparently successful recording artist living the high life in L.A. and his friend, who possesses some measure of marketing talent. Rounded out with girlfriends, other assorted attractive female hangers-on, and what appears to be one of the security guards of the condominium complex in which the recording artist resides.As far from ""everyday normal"" as this group might seem to be, they could very easily be real people, particularly in La-La Land. And the best part is that they reacted to events in a very normal, everyday human way. Weird stuff happens, and so they try to make sense of it, try to get a look at what's going on. And what they see makes no sense. There are no moments of inspired intuition, no really extraordinary feats of heroism or even ordinary ones.Every plan of action the characters come up with fails, their safe-zones continually diminish, and characters are inexorably picked off. This is mirrored by the larger reaction of the military and their attempts to resist the alien menace. While slightly more successful in causing some injury to the aliens, their ultimate futility is seen when what looks to be an incredibly agile stealth bomber dances and dodges its way through aerial combat to release the Hail-Mary tactical nuke missile even as it is finally shot down. We follow the missile as it tracks toward the largest of alien craft and BOOM! Lots of bright light and big noise, and we see the alien vessel crashing to the ground as a smoldering wreck. Yay! But wait, holy crap, and oh noes! The aliens have regenerative/repair abilities congruent with their clearly organic-machine nature. The actors best moments come when they convey the despair and frustration of seeing every soap-bubble of hope unavoidably popped.Earth is a rich and rare cache of resources presumably not found in many places in the vast, cold reaches of space. The aliens are here to secure their own continued survival with our delicious goodies. Our own species does this exact same thing to plants and animals across the globe. So what more motivation do the aliens need? And how could we realistically resist? None, and we can't, any more than the Amazon or marine life could. I don't know how much more ""real"" the story could get.The movie doesn't satisfy the audience with a heroic victory for mankind. Or any victory, for that matter. And in this, it bucks the seemingly inescapable trend for reassuring us with some message about how adhering to noble virtues will allow us to win out in the end. To me, the film demonstrated exactly how fragile and small we and our planet are in the grander scheme of the universe. It's an ugly, cold truth, and we might prefer to be deluded that we can overcome if we just (add inspiring platitude here). But if our real-life local and global disasters are any indication, those sorts of wins only come at the very end and from the efforts of survivors after the fact. In the scenario this movie presents, we won't get that chance. Were aliens ever to come knocking, humanity as it is now is simply boned. And that's it.Lots of people will not like or want to hear that message from a work of fiction. But I think the makers of this film deserve credit for their much more likely message of futility. It's not something we get a lot of from movies.

Skyline (2010) - IMDb," Great visuals, soundtrack and action, story, acting and script lacking",TheLittleSongbird28,March/2011,5/10,"I don't think Skyline is a bad movie as such. While there were better movies from 2010 such as The King's Speech, The Social Network, The Fighter and Toy Story 3, there are also worse such as Fred:The Movie, The Last Airbender, Vampires Suck and Clash of the Titans.Skyline is not a good movie, but it isn't in my opinion bad either. If anything, my feelings for Skyline are very mixed. I have seen some comparisons to Battle:Los Angeles, and I do agree this is the better movie, while Skyline did have a lot of problems Battle:Los Angeles was clichéd, under-directed and over-edited and other than Aaron Eckhart, a decent idea and one or two decent scenes there was little of redeeming value.Starting with the good things of Skyline, the visuals look absolutely great. The cinematography and editing are slick, the scenery is striking and the colours and lighting are bold, but the real star is the special effects which are superb. The sound is another plus, very explosive and authentic, and the soundtrack is memorable, not too generic and fits decently with the mood. Also, the action in general is explosive and exciting.Skyline does also have its flaws though. The characters are not as clichéd or indifferent as those of Battle:LA and some of the worst of the year, but to be honest I did find some of the characterisation underdeveloped and irritating. The dialogue is often cheesy and seems to be taking an exercise in high camp, and the climax while quite freaky and atmospheric feels like a different tone to the rest of the movie and this was a tone that jarred a bit. The story in its structure is quite soap-opera-like, and can get predictable and pedestrian, the direction is sometimes good sometimes flat and the acting is also uneven ranging from over-eager to bland.All in all, Skyline was not a bad movie in my opinion, certainly not as bad as I'd heard, but it is a hardly exceptional movie either. 5/10 Bethany Cox",0,"[think, skyline, bad, movie, better, movie, king, speech, social, network, fighter, toy, story, also, bad, fred, movie, last, airbender, vampire, suck, clash, good, movie, opinion, bad, either, anything, feeling, skyline, mixed, see, comparison, battle, los, angeles, agree, better, movie, skyline, lot, problem, battle, los, angeles, clichéd, aaron, eckhart, decent, idea, one, two, decent, scene, little, redeem, good, thing, skyline, visuals, look, absolutely, great, cinematography, edit, slick, scenery, strike, colour, light, bold, real, star, special, effect, superb, sound, another, plus, explosive, authentic, soundtrack, memorable, generic, fit, decently, mood, also, action, general, explosive, also, flaw, though, character, clichéd, indifferent, battle, la, bad, ...]","[i, do not think, skyline, is, a bad movie, as, such, while, were, better movies, from, such, as, the king, speech, the social network, the fighter, toy story, are, also worse such, as, fred:the movie, the last airbender, vampires, suck, clash, of, the titans.skyline, is, not, a good movie, it, is, not, in, my opinion, bad, either, if, anything, my feelings, for, skyline, are very mixed, i, have seen, some comparisons, to, battle:los angeles, i, do agree, is, the better movie, while, skyline, did have, a lot, of, problems battle:los angeles, was clichéd, under-directed and over-edited and other, than, aaron eckhart, a decent idea, one or two decent scenes, was, little, of, redeeming, value.starting, with, the good things, of, skyline, the visuals, look, absolutely great, the cinematography, editing, are, slick, the scenery, is, striking, the colours, lighting, are, bold, the real star, is, the special effects, are, superb, the sound, is, very explosive and authentic, the soundtrack, is, memorable, not too generic, ...]",0.10454263773902216,0.006532995718648949,0,2,2

Species II (1998) - IMDb, Enjoyable trash.,gridoon29,September/2001,6/10,"The people who are stating that this movie is the worst sequel they've ever seen obviously never saw ""Hercules II"" or ""Jaws 3-D"" or ""Hellraiser II"". Now, I am not about to tell you that this is a great film, but if you set your expectations low, you are likely to have fun. Despite the icky (and variable in quality, though impressive in the last 10 minutes) special effects and the large amounts of blood and t&a, the film never becomes truly disturbing, because you're never meant to take it 100% seriously. Michael Madsen understood that, to be sure, and thanks to his trademarked coolness, he walks away with the picture. As for Natasha Henstridge, she has more or less a supporting part, but one that is rather imaginatively linked to the central story line.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) - IMDb," If this was an apology for the Emoji Movie, then apology accepted!",sirwillisiv14,December/2018,10/10,"I have to say, and no pun-intended: Into the Spider-Verse is a total marvel, all the way down to its stylish and diverse styles of animation to its bold, sophisticated storytelling. The visuals are absolutely enchanting. Fast, colorful, and distinct. Something Sony Animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. With the various kinds of Spider-Men and Marvel villains featured in this story, the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. Notably in this case are Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Noir, whose universe takes place in 1930s New York, boasts a dark, shadowy vibe similar to Sin City, Peni Parker has a bubbly anime look, and Spider-Ham is a bouncy, eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. Even with these different identities, the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. Heck, one of the most hard-hitting, poignant lines is spoken by Spider-Ham, the breakout comedic relief.Miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. I really enjoy the blend of 3D models with traditional 2D movement. It's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. I also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. Kingpin is a character I don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics, just appearing as a generic, heavy-set bald brute, when he's really an enormous, borderline non-human tank. Kingpin looks excellent in this film, with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. He's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. Doc Ock is another example, portrayed as a brilliant, but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. I didn't feel like I needed to know more about her character, she was such a fun villainess to watch. She really added to the suspense in some action sequences.I really loved the story. I thought it was rich with charm and thrills. Granted, I did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike, such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming, and I certainly wish some characters (espeically Miles' uncle) had more screentime, but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: The writing is mature. First of all, it's a Sony Animation product. If you look at this company's past work, some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. Into the Spider-Verse is a welcome departure. Passion and integrity was put into this project. The writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. Heck, the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant, almost like an arthouse film. I've never had such a cool, yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. Nothing was forced, nothing felt out-of-place, nothing took me out of immersion. The tone and pacing is very adult, even when something excessively goofy like Spider-Ham is on-screen. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be dark and distressing, but lighthearted and amusing. There's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. Well...there is that after-credits scene, but it was quite hilarious, so I let it pass.That's the most I can say without spoiling a lot of the film. I want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. To close, Into the Spider-Verse is everything I hoped it would be. This is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. Sleek, colorful, funny, emotional, frenetic. This film skillfully balances all these elements. There is never a moment that felt forced, it never talks down to the audience. It's a mature and stylish take on the Spider-Man mythos, and perhaps the best big-screen Spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. I didn't have a single issue with this film. I was dazzled and moved throughout. Sony Animation, if this was your apology for The Emoji Movie, then apology goddamn accepted.

There are clever ideas here and there, a few laughs, the occasional decent special effect (I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D, which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive), but the lame, tossed-together script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable.

Spy Kids 4-D: All the Time in the World (2011) - IMDb," A unimaginative, pointless, cheap family film",freemantle_uk20,August/2011,2/10,"Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns, plus it was using the stupid idea of smell-o-vision. And this family film does not disappoint.Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain, Tik Tok, and starts a family with her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook). A year later a new villain has emerged, the Time Keeper, who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director, Danger D'Amo (Jeremy Piven), to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device.There are many problems with Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It's a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before: the dad is a workaholic; there is animosity between step-mum and step-daughter as the step-mum tries to get closer to the children; the revelation of a lie, and so many others. The humour is crude, mostly poo, fart and vomit gags, basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns: time puns, dog puns and smell puns – we're not stupid! The action is rudimentary; it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can't guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven't seen enough movies. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck, not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story.A movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination, which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart; they ask questions, see plot holes and come up with ideas involving sci-fi concepts. The best family and children's movies are clever, well-plotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working.Most of the acting is sub-par. The child leads are bland and not natural actors; it's your typical weak-child acting, and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi Smit-McPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun, but I'm sure that's because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same, having fun and just being over the top.As movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez, who's done great movies like Sin City, From Dusk to Dawn and the ""Mexico"" Trilogy. Let's hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2.And I am sure you are asking the big question – what was the Scratch-and-Sniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick.

Star Trek (2009) - IMDb, Review from comicbookculture.net,jason-22812,May/2009,8/10,"Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews.

Star Trek (2009) - IMDb, The plot makes no sense whatsoever. (SPOILER ALERT),jmiller203211,May/2009,3/10,"I'm not going to hit this from a scientific perspective. That would be too easy and would just invite others to castigate me for not ""suspending disbelief"" during a fun summer sci-fi. No, this movie sucks on a very base level. The first, and most disturbing part of the movie is the villain, Nero, who I think is the worst villain Hollywood has given us, and Hollywood once gave us Arnold as Ice Man. Nero is awful because his motivation makes no sense whatsoever.As the story goes, Nero is furious at Spock, and by extension his whole race of Vulcans, because Spock did not get to Romulus' star in time to save it from super nova, which destroyed his planet and all those he loved and cared for. In the process both he and Spock are sucked into a black hole and spit out the other side well in the past, except at different times, Nero 25 years before Spock. In waiting 25 years for Spock to come through the black hole as he had, Nero and his crew seethe with rage and plot their revenge against Spock and his evil race of Vulcans.But why? Did Spock create the super nova? No. That was explained as a natural disaster. Did Spock try to save his planet? Yes. In fact, he had every reason to believe that he was going to die in the process. After failing to stave off the super nova, he was sucked into a black hole, which is assumed to destroy anything entering it (after all, black holes literally crush atoms to the point of not existing). Personally I think that makes Spock a hero to the Romulans! Having a vendetta against Spock and the Vulcans would be like tracking down and killing the family of a fire fighter who died in your house while he tried to save your wife and kids. That makes no sense. None. Last, Nero is now in the past, no? Why doesn't he just go about saving his planet from destruction? He's got the ""red matter"" to do it.The other thing that ticked me off was the silly string of ""accidents"" that put a gang of 22 year-olds in command of the Federation's flagship. Do they not have even a single 40 year-old who has actually been in space before? It's even worse than that if you think about it. Before the ship takes off Kirk is about to be booted out of Starfleet—but now he's put in charge?I'm willing to suspend disbelief in sci-fi movie, but there's a difference between suspending disbelief and watching a movie like I'm a 3-year old. 3 stars out of 10.",0,"[go, hit, scientific, perspective, would, easy, would, invite, others, castigate, suspend, disbelief, fun, summer, movie, suck, base, level, first, disturb, part, movie, villain, nero, think, bad, villain, hollywood, give, us, hollywood, give, us, arnold, ice, man, nero, awful, motivation, make, sense, story, go, nero, furious, spock, extension, whole, race, vulcan, spock, get, romulus, star, time, save, super, nova, destroyed, planet, love, care, process, spock, suck, black, hole, spit, side, well, past, except, different, time, nero, year, spock, wait, year, spock, come, black, hole, nero, crew, seethe, rage, plot, revenge, spock, evil, race, spock, create, super, nova, explain, natural, disaster, spock, ...]","[i, am not going, to, hit, from, a scientific perspective, that would be, too easy, would just invite, others, to, castigate, me, for, not, suspending, disbelief, during, a fun summer, sci-fi, this movie, sucks, on, a very base level, the first, most disturbing part, of, the movie, is, the villain, nero, i think is, the worst villain hollywood, has given, us, hollywood, once gave, us, arnold, as, ice man, nero, is, awful, because, his motivation, makes, no sense, whatsoever.as, the story, goes, nero, is, furious, at, spock, by, extension, his whole race, of, vulcans, because, spock, did not get, to, romulus, star, in, time, to, save, it, from, super nova, destroyed, his planet, all those he, loved, cared, for, in, process, both he, spock, are sucked, into, a black hole, spit, the, other side, well, in, the past, except at, different times, nero 25 years, before, spock, in, waiting, ...]",0.031089726759048784,-0.01687837912021441,0,0,0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - IMDb," Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!",ivo-cobra825,April/2016,10/10,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) - IMDb," Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!",ivo-cobra828,April/2016,8/10,"Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.",1,"[star, war, episode, vi, return, jedi, third, sequel, original, star, war, trilogy, flaw, yet, entertain, solid, third, sequel, epic, conclusion, original, star, war, trilogy, honestly, opinion, return, jedi, far, way, better, film, force, awakens, movie, disaster, suck, rather, watch, movie, time, favorite, film, series, love, movie, much, like, love, first, two, movie, like, think, good, point, film, lot, problem, hurt, movie, still, enjoy, movie, lot, fun, return, jedi, direct, time, richard, marquand, different, director, direct, irvin, kershner, george, lucas, movie, release, year, born, film, pretty, good, way, thing, suffers, problem, like, movie, first, hour, set, back, planet, tatooine, rescue, mission, ...]","[star wars, episode vi – return, of, the jedi, is, a third sequel, in, the original star wars, trilogy, it, is, flawed, yet very entertaining, solid third sequel, an epic conclusion, to, the original star wars, trilogy, honestly, in, my opinion return, of, the jedi, is, far way, better film, than, the force, awakens, that, movie, was, a disaster, it, sucked, i, rather watch, movie, any time, it, is, not, my, favorite film, in, the series, i, do, not, love, this movie, that, much, like, i, love, first, two movies, i, like, it and it, think, it, is, very good, at, some points, the film, has, a lot, of, problems, hurts, the movie, i, still have enjoyed, this movie, i, had, a lot, of, fun, return, of, the jedi, is directed, this time, from, richard, marquand, a different director, than, it, was directed, from, irvin kershner and george lucas, this movie, was released, on, the same year, ...]",-0.008197553667983134,0.07676757452148848,1,1,3

Stealth (2005) - IMDb, Stupefying and hilariously terrible film,mike-verdone9,August/2005,3/10,"Stealth is the best movie of the summer. And when I say best, what I mean is that it's the most hackneyed and predictable 130-million dollar piece of crap action flick of the year. Stealth has no intentional redeeming qualities whatsoever, and plays into every single textbook stereotype of the genre. Thus, if you're the kind of person who loves Mystery Science Theatre 3000, you must, must go see Stealth immediately.Stealth follows the exploits of three Navy pilots in a top secret program involving, well, experimental stealth fighters. There's Lt. Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas): the white-bread pretty-boy with a smarmy attitude with a history of breaking rules and taking too many risks, played like a twisted caricature of 'Maverick' Mitchell of Top Gun. There's Kara Wade (Jessica Biel): the obligatory Caucasian hottie pilot who spouts clichéd feminist rhetoric and sports an ""I can do anything you can do, better"" attitude aligned more with the Spice Girls than Andrea Dworkin; the pink teddy lingerie and frilly bra she apparently wears under her LuLu Lemon flight suit don't help her cause either. Finally, there's Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx) the black male who listens to rap music, has indiscriminate sex with as many women as possible, and poses for imaginary photographers in his bedroom. For no apparent reason he's also a mathematician and numerology nut who later expounds that ""one is a prime number"".The fourth character is ""Tin Man"", the artificially intelligent experimental stealth fighter assigned to the squadron. Its brain uses ""quantum computation"" and processes ""20 terabits per second"" which is pretty impressive until you realize the number doesn't make any sense. Having a computer as sympathetic character is a pretty cool idea. At least it was in 1968 when Kubrick made 2001: A Space Odyssey, though Tin Man's inflective voice and bizarre penchant for rock music suggests a closer relation to Max-- the shipboard computer in Disney's Flight of the Navigator-- than HAL 9000. This doesn't stop the writers from making bizarre homages to Kubrick's space opus; in fact one major plot point centers on the computer overhearing a conversation in a scene shot much like HAL's famous lip-reading in the Pod. The computer also has a big red eye, which is dumb because it doesn't need to see anything with it, but cool because it helps the computer emote more effectively.After a minor sortie in Rangoon (where ""three terrorist leaders"" are meeting in ""a building still under construction"" (which is important because now they can implode the building without killing any civilians-- go America!)), and then an extended Thailand vacation sequence where the pilots engage in tedious ham-fisted metaphysical discussions about whether Tin Man is actually alive, the computer predictably goes nuts and decides to attack a fortified terrorist camp in Tzadzikistan or something that just got access to some old Russian nuclear warheads and SCUD launchers. (We know they're terrorists because of the turbans and the fact that they're moving the warheads around on carts pulled by mules.) The nukes get blown up but radioactive dust falls down the mountain side and kills ""thousands of innocent farmers"" which I guess is bad but they don't spend too long worrying about it because they have to catch the psycho stealth.Usual stuff happens after that-- a pilot hits the side of a mountain, another one goes down inexplicably in North Korea, and the remaining one has to avenge his friend's death and rescue the other pilot from the Koreans' evil clutches. The ability of these planes to be in Rangoon, Tzadzikistan, Russia, Alaska, and Korea on just a few tanks of gas is explained by their ability to hit hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 5 which is cool because it's like warp speed on Star Trek-- they punch a button and the planes zip away in a bullet cone of displaced air and end up in a new locale more suitable for extreme aerobatics. They also get to fly against the Russians which is funny because the Russians obviously haven't built any new planes since the fall of the Soviet Union, which begs the question: why do the stealths have such trouble with them? Why don't they just hit the Mach 5 button and get out of there? Is there something about the shocking yellow and brown paint job on the anachronistic Migs that impedes the functioning of hypersonic engines? The plot isn't really important-- what is important is that the movie contains a wealth of brain-dead inaccuracies for geeks to make fun of. From bizarre phrases like ""the Stealth has firewall-ed the transponder!"" to the fact that the Stealth's brain is made alternately from quantum hardware, neural networks, and DNA sequences depending on which one looks coolest for the effects sequence, and was apparently programmed by hand by one man using a futuristic language reminiscent of Matlab, to the way that the naval command is powered by transparent lexan PC cases decked out with coloured LCD cooling fans, this movie just stinks of technical naivety due to lack of research as opposed to creative liberty.Stealth is a movie that begs its own drinking game.

"Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) - IMDb", The whole Keaton kaboodle,highclark3,January/2005,10/10,"Buster Keaton was a lunatic. He had to have been. The stunts he was able to pull off in this movie leave me questioning his sanity. This film has moments where you won't believe his stunts weren't done via some nifty camera forgery. It's just amazing that his stunts were accomplished while one camera(yes, just one) was aimed at a spot that was marked for Buster to hit. This precision had to be met or death and disaster could follow. This was most apparent in the cyclone scene with the wall of a house that fell to the ground. Any deviation by an inch from the mark and a house could fall on top of Buster's head. I had to watch that scene over and over again. This film is filled with great gymnastics from Buster, as he did hit all of his marks. Although this movie has some of Buster's best comedic gymnastics, there are a couple of memorable scenes of pantomime. There's the scene near the beginning of the film when Buster is trying on an array of hats for his father. Buster looks right into the camera as if looking into a mirror, just a great effect. And later there's another scene where Buster tries to break his father out of jail by pantomiming the instructions of escape by using only his hands and a loaf of bread. By the end of the film you'll be marveling at Buster's dexterity while he operates the steamboat by climbing up and over or jumping down and around the ship, running the ship by himself and with the help of a few helpfully placed ropes.

Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992) - IMDb," ""Listen to your mother!""",The_Movie_Cat14,November/2000,5/10,"I have little to say about this movie other than it is nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe. Actually quite amusing in places, it will strike a chord with anyone who has an interfering mother (and God knows I have!) as Estelle Getty invades Stallone's life.I fail to see the reason for all the bad spirit directed at this film. The incidental music is a little repetitive and it's admittedly a one-joke plot. But it is a fairly good joke, and would have made for a superb hour-length TV movie. Unfortunately it's a 90 minute cinema film and so doesn't maintain its momentum all the way through.I've seen people criticise the film for Stallone not getting to be ""funny"" in this movie. I mean, have you heard of a straight man?? Sylvester's contribution to the comedy is his underplayed reaction to his mother's obsessive behaviour. What do you expect him to do, dress up and tell jokes?Admittedly, the surprisingly violent aspects of the film don't sit well, and it's hard to laugh at Getty when she's just shot a man and splattered his blood all over an airplane runway. Another problem is that her chemistry with Stallone isn't as pin-sharp as it could be; the two leave notable pauses in between lines. Maybe a few more takes could have honed up the reaction time, but generally it's fine, and Stallone really makes an effort to make it work.Not an all-time classic, certainly, but a pleasant enough film to pass a Sunday afternoon.

Street Fighter (1994) - IMDb, Why I defend Street Fighter to this day.,solidgameboy12-127,November/2010,7/10,"Street Fighter is a strange video game movie. The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.The Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.Lt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.From there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.Like I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau (""The Room"") when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.Well, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.It's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, ""This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it."" In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already.7/10.",1,"[street, fighter, strange, video, game, movie, game, amaze, fighter, wide, array, character, different, continent, battle, movie, surprisingly, plot, would, think, bison, raul, julia, final, performance, portrayed, megalomanical, super, villain, dream, cause, collapse, entire, world, kill, large, number, hostage, unless, paid, ransom, worthy, evil, standard, create, breed, super, soldier, kidnapping, queen, england, create, world, base, image, trust, silly, guile, jean, claude, van, damme, approach, situation, save, hostage, hopefully, put, bison, ice, thus, stop, plan, world, movie, basically, almost, two, hour, fan, service, various, subplots, almost, character, street, fighter, universe, zangief, dee, jay, work, bison, muscle, computer, technician, respectively, balrog, honda, get, ...]","[street fighter, is, a strange video game movie, the game, is, amazing, 2d fighter, with, a wide array, of, characters, from, different continents, battle, it, out, for...something.the movie, surprisingly, has, more plot, than, you, would think, m. bison, raul julia, in, his final performance, is now portrayed, as, a megalomanical super villain, has, dreams, of, causing, collapse, to, the entire world, such, as, killing, a large number, of, hostages, unless, paid, a ransom worthy, of, dr, evil standards, creating, a breed, of, super soldiers, kidnapping, the queen, of, england, create, his own world, based, off of, his image, trust me, it, is, as silly, as, it, sounds.lt, guile, jean claude van, damme, approaches, the situation, in that, he, has, to, save, the hostages, hopefully put, bison, on, ice, once, for, thus stopping, his plans, for, world, domination.from, there, on in, the movie, is, basically, almost, two hour fan service, with, various subplots, ...]",0.1644066309040754,0.025371228266617845,0,2,2
Street Fighter (1994) - IMDb," I perform the ""Shun Goku Satsu"" on this movie",hancocka29,December/2004,1/10,"Shortly after the beginning of the disastrous Street Fighter movie, we see the words ""Based on the Capcom game Street Fighter"" displayed. How ironic, then, that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most well-known arcade games of all time, the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape, butcher, and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation, while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece, at least stayed relatively faithful to the games.Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams, someone decided that the tournament-based, Enter the Dragon-like storyline of the game would never fly with the American movie-going public. And so it was rewritten, becoming a typical American action flick, with plenty of huge explosions, loud gunfights, and thinly veiled right-wing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile, and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind, are they?Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character, bar none, from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition. Chun Li, played perhaps the only well-casted actor in this dreck, Ming Na Wen, has become a mere reporter (with a smirking Balrog and a Hawaiian shirted E. Honda as her camera crew, natch) instead of a detective, Ryu and Ken are incompetent gun smugglers, and Jimmy/Blanka and Charles/Nash become the same person in one of the most laughably absurd plot contrivances ever thought up. There are so many incongruities between this movie and the game that it becomes difficult to tell if they are merely the result of the incompetence of the writers, or their actual intent. For example, were the writers (whom I hope are begging for change at bus stop right about now) aware that ""Shadaloo"" was merely the name of M. Bison's organization, and not the name of a fictitious South Asian country? (which conveniently rests atop present-day Myanmar?) Or were they simply not paying close enough attention to the game's storyline? Who knows?Consider the most egregious example of the screenwriters' disdain for the source material: M. Bison walks into his laboratory and addresses one of the scientists there as ""Doctor Dhalsim."" Was Dhalsim a doctor in the game? Do we ever see him fight in this movie? Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions, of course, is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named ""Dhalsim"" just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film. I can only imagine what Akuma would have looked like had the writers decided to include him.Anyone who played through Street Fighter knows that each character had at least one defining personality trait. Ryu was the stoic martial artist seeking to become a true warrior, his friend Ken was brash and arrogant, Vega was obsessed with beauty, Sagat wanted revenge on Ryu for scarring his chest, etc. It should come as no surprise that none of these traits appear in any shape, form or fashion in this movie, and in the rare moment that a character DOES act like their game counterpart, it's more often the result some sort of lame contrivance than a scripted personality trait. Chun Li's cameraman Balrog only happens to box. When Ryu and Ken and ""inducted"" into M. Bison's army, the uniforms they wear just happen to resemble the white and red karate gis they wore in the game. To top it all off, M. Bison gives a lengthy explanation of how his ""magnetic levitation"" that allows him to perform the movie's equivalent of the Psycho Crusher. It's as if the screenwriters set out to make a completely different movie, and were only told halfway through that it was supposed to be a Street Fighter movie.Which brings me to my next point; there's little actual ""street fighting"", giving fans of the games precious little to chew on through the movie's running length. Whatever fight scenes we get are brief and unexciting, and are nothing next to other martial arts movies. Instead we get Jean Claude Van Damme running from scene to scene, spewing out pithy one-liner after one-liner, gleefully trampling any remaining source material that hasn't already been butchered. Only Raul Julia and Ming Na Wen come through with any dignity left; they apparently realized what a turkey this film was and at least tried to have some fun with their roles. Their noble efforts, however, are sunk by the awful screenplay, which should be an example to future filmmakers of how NOT to adapt a video game to the big screen.As an aside note, there was actually an arcade game made of this movie.

Supergirl (1984) - IMDb, A gentle tale worth watching with a relaxed mind.,dwtaxi14,December/2006,7/10,"Watching Supergirl this week for the first time since childhood I see it with fresh eyes and a newfound appreciation of the movie. Supergirl must be considered separate and unrelated to the Superman movie foursome or it will fall short. There is not supposed to be a comparison. The Superman movies are action epics, Supergirl is the story of strength growing out of innocence.Watching Supergirl now with an understanding of focus that I did not have when younger, I truly enjoy it. Helen Slater, Peter O'Tool, Peter Cook and Maureen Teefy all put in superb performances. Mia Farrow tends to overact the part of Selena, but then the character believes herself larger than life. Brenda Vaccaro could use a little more self assertion, but does alright. Marc McClure is of course an undeniably talented actor, though his part in this film is minor. I am forced to scream at the screen however; Why the hell do you wear a camera if you aren't going to use it when a major news piece flies into your lap?I remember being dismissive of Supergirl when I was younger; due in part to the use of magic which has no part in the Superman films, but mainly I suspect due to the ludicrous man-eating excavator scene. This scene remains the major absurdity of the movie. Supposed to be terrifying it comes off as a rather poor imitation of the hundred Volkswagens from Herbie Rides Again. It isn't scary, its stupid.Apart from that scene, Supergirl is good gentle viewing and a nice counterpoint to Superman.It is hard to describe my exact feelings, but I do feel that standing on its own Supergirl should be considered a success and I deeply regret never having a chance to watch the sequels that were never made.",1,"[watch, supergirl, week, first, time, since, childhood, see, fresh, eye, newfound, appreciation, movie, supergirl, must, consider, separate, unrelated, superman, movie, foursome, fall, short, suppose, comparison, superman, movie, action, epic, supergirl, story, strength, grow, supergirl, understand, focus, young, truly, enjoy, helen, slater, peter, peter, cook, maureen, teefy, put, superb, performance, mia, farrow, tends, overact, part, selena, character, belief, large, life, brenda, vaccaro, could, use, little, self, assertion, alright, marc, mcclure, course, undeniably, talented, actor, though, part, film, minor, force, scream, screen, however, hell, wear, camera, go, use, major, news, piece, fly, lap, remember, dismissive, supergirl, young, due, part, use, magic, part, ...]","[watching supergirl, this week, for, the first time, since, childhood i see it, with, fresh eyes, a newfound appreciation, of, the movie, supergirl, must be considered, separate and unrelated, to, the superman movie foursome, it, will fall, short, is not supposed, to, be, a comparison, the superman movies, are, action, epics, supergirl, is, the story, of, strength, growing, out of, innocence.watching supergirl, now, with, an understanding, of, focus, that, i, did not have, when, younger, i, truly enjoy, it, helen, slater, peter, o'tool, peter, cook, maureen teefy, put, in, superb performances, mia farrow, tends, to, overact, the part, of, selena, then, the character, believes, herself, larger, than, life, brenda vaccaro, could use, a little more self assertion, does, alright, marc mcclure is, of, course, an undeniably talented actor, though, his part, in, this film, is, minor, i, am forced, to, scream, at, the screen, however, why, the hell, do, you, wear, a camera, ...]",-0.018760957232859993,-0.05200190855828644,1,0,0
Supergirl (1984) - IMDb," inventive, creative, HIGHLY underated, artistic",Andras_J27,November/2002,5/10,"I could make this very long, or I could make it strict. stricted? yes... This is a truely wonderfull movie that on a mainstreame level has never gotten the attention it deserves. Faye Dunaway is a excellant adversory to Helen Slater and almost everyone in this movie seems to have a great chemistry together wich is outputed highley during it. The special FX are wonderfull and were advanced for its time, many in the movie even to today's standards. It has its roots in artistic litrature, it has heart, because the movie is about a teenager there is a vulrability to it wich feels more humane and personal to a level of a teenager myself...unlike the Superman movies where you simply feel ""yes, he's super...he can do anything. good for him"" This movie suffered for many reasons wich isn't about its story. It was marketed purley as a Superman ""action sueprhero"" sort of movie. When the fact is there is a more gentile apraoch to this film, sourcery, love and lots of imaginative things wich make it very unique to the superhero genre. unfortunatley it doesn't do it much favours considering to many it is the worst superhero movie ever. Everything about this movie is very imaginative and creative. From Supergirl flying out of a lake without getting wet to her almost flawless flying ballet (THATS when u believe a person can fly. Unlike Supermans blue screen FX) and the highly inspireing fair ground scenes. This is purley fantasy. Not a Spiderman/Superman action superhero movie wich it was promoted to be. So its real targeted audience didn't want to see it as its trailer and promotion didn't look like ""their sorta thing"" and the people that did see it were dissapointed as it wasn't what it was said to be. so let me say...STUPID marketting team!simply...its like making American Pie SOUND LIKE the matrix. Many people saw Supergirl and did not expect to see many of the things they saw.
If this film was marketed the way it should have been and released the way it should have been (some countries got a seriously bad edited version wich effected the charactors allot) then this would have been the success everyone thought at the time and still deserves to be This is a great movie and its one of my favourites. I don't think I could praise it enough. I think its not what many people wanted ot see back then though...they wanted explosions, action and they wanted Superman to fit into this film.I think the fact that Supergirl arrived on earth in the supercostume without no actual logic was bad. Because firstly you need rules, and even more so in fantasy movies. Because it may be fantasy but you still should believe it. I think it could have easily been written in for Supergirl to get her costume. Zaltar could have made her it because she is a big admirer of her cousin Superman. But no, unfortunatley it isn't once explained how and were she got her costume from. Also...the instant costume portrays that she is an instant hero and she wasn't wich let many people down. As she was still nieve, cute and girly and not the strong wilded heroine she turned out to be at the end.Also, this movie arguable did not fit into the superman mythology very well...But so be it. There is no flaw in this movie that could effect the enjoyment and believability of the movie. On its DVD release there are more visual flaws then I saw on its video release wich is surprising. Not many however but on her first ever flying shot there are...wich makes me cringe. HOWEVER, I am still to see better better flying in a movie that isn't from Supergirl. Highlights of this movie deffanitly are Supergirls flying ballet (you will never see anything as visually wonderfull and pretty as this in a film) and Supergirls scenes with Ethan. This movie is full of heart and art, with beautifull actors and its all acompanied by a wonderfull score wich captures allot of emotion and depth.I will end this review with that you WILL believe a girl can fly.

Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.",0,"[loser, teen, bitten, insect, becomes, superhero, dragonfly, superhero, movie, late, spoof, movie, hit, screen, sadly, however, despite, presence, david, zucker, involve, airplane, top, secret, naked, gun, movie, still, suffers, fault, recent, spoof, mainly, dumb, fun, fault, mainly, lie, gag, simply, funny, enough, joke, work, nail, gun, scene, part, simply, fall, flat, spoof, example, whole, fart, sequence, blazing, saddle, one, key, thing, best, spoof, movie, like, airplane, although, dialog, extremely, funny, cast, part, play, completely, straight, make, even, funnier, even, simple, dialog, foreground, may, well, funny, thing, happen, behind, cast, funny, key, thing, plot, sort, hang, gag, recent, trend, seems, take, ...]","[when, a loser teen, is bitten, by, an insect, he, becomes, the superhero, dragonfly...superhero movie, is, the latest spoof movie, to, hit, the screens, sadly however, despite, the presence, of, david zucker, was involved, with, airplane, top secret, the naked gun movies, it, still suffers, from, the fault, most recent spoofs, have...mainly, it, is, more dumb, than, fun, the fault, mainly lies, with, the gags, it, is, simply not funny, enough, some of, the jokes, do work, such, as, the nail gun scene, other parts, simply fall, flat, the x-men spoof, for, example, the whole farting sequence, blazing saddles, is, not, of, the key things, about, the best spoof movies, like, airplane, is, that although, the dialog, is, extremely funny, the cast, for, the most part play, is, completely straight, makes, it, even funnier, even when, is, simple dialog, in, the foreground, may well be, funny things, happening, behind, the cast, again funny, the other key thing, is, that, they all have, a plot, of, sorts, to, hang, the gags, on.the recent trend, ...]",0.1521010326656273,0.009085961395643407,0,2,2
Superman III (1983) - IMDb, A very underreted solid decent third Superman sequel and that not a bad one,ivo-cobra87,October/2016,8/10,"Superman III (1983) is very extremely underrated bashed hated film and I am going to defend this film today! It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies of all time. Yes you read the title I love Superman III it is my childhood movie, I grew up watching this film and it was the first film I saw as a kid. Since I saw half of the second film Richard Lester version. Christopher Reeve will always be Clark Kent Superman for me no one else can replace him I don't care what anyone says. I kept wining to my parents that I want to see Superman movie and in the video store a lady video store owner gave me Superman III on VHS when I was a kid and it was the only movie she had. Superman III is MILES way better than crappy lame Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice I hate those movies. I find this film enjoyable, well-done, and extremely underrated. The effects & technology are extremely dated (especially the computers), but this is still a decent, well-done film. Plot: Synthetic kryptonite laced with tobacco tar splits Superman in two: good Clark Kent and bad Man of Steel. Thing's I love in this movie, why I gave the most highest rating in this film and why I am defending it:Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, If anyone could be Superman, It is Christopher Reeve! The opening sequence with the ""fools of Metropolis"" was amusing, in a slap-stick way; this intentionally reminded me of some of the old slap-stick routines from years before (Laurel & Hardy; Three Stooges; etc.). And, sure, a lot of Superman III was comedic, but a lot of this was just in line with the Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) character. Superman/Clark going back to Smallville for his high school reunion & running into Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole), etc. Very cool sequence, and I liked seeing Superman return to his ""roots"". Also, based on the reunion you get an idea of the character's ages - i.e., the reunion said ""Class of 1965"" & since the film came out in 1983 (and supposedly was set in ""real time), then Clark & his class-mates were all around 36 years old at that point.This film focus more on Lana Lang, Clark's first love, Lois was Clark's eternal Love but Lana was his first love. Annette O'Toole was perfectly as Lana Lang after long 18 years Annette was cast as Martha Kent in Smallville. In Superman: The Movie Lana Lang was played by actress Diane Sherry and she only had a cameo scene and than she disappeared from the rest of the film. Here we find out more about Clark and Lana's love! I saw Clark and Lois in the first two films but now we see more Clark and Lana's love story. Superman save's Ricky (Paul Kaethler) Lana's son in the corn filed from the tractor that scene was really serious, the kid could have been seriously crushed, it that could have happened in real life. This film was filmed and released in year of 1983 the year that I was born. This was my first Superman movie and it is my childhood film, I love it to death and I will always cherished. The whole sequence where Superman was exposed to the ""Red Kryptonite"" (though they didn't call it that in the episode) and became dark/somewhat evil. They did a great job of transforming Superman/Clark to look dirty/unshaven/burned out (even his costume was darker!), and not only disinterested in helping others - but also being somewhat malicious as well. I especially liked the battle that Superman had with his good & bad selves in the junkyard; I'm guessing this battle may have been metaphorical. It was also interesting on another level, because we saw what would happen if Superman had been evil instead of good. That scene was also used in Smallville Season 2 Episode 4: Red Clark was exposed to Red kryptonite and he evil. Richard Pryor as the scam artist Gus Gorman was good and hilarious the same time - obviously, because of his inclusion many fans probably dismissed the film as a comedy; however, his presence brought a light-heartiness to the film that was reminiscent of the comedic Ned Beatty character from Superman I & II. Christopher Reeve was perfect as Clark Kent/Superman he acted brilliant his character, he is the only Superman and superhero for me.This is Richard Lester original version film and he didn't had to re shot scenes from Richard Donner. The rest of the actors did a solid job and I really didn't had any problems with them. Robert Vaughn was a great villain I am glad the franchise had a new villain in all films Lex Luthor was five time the villain in all Superman franchise movies.Ross Webster was a great villain and the scene where Vera (Annie Ross) becomes a robot and she becomes evil really scares me. Brad Wilson played by Gavan O'Herlihy: Lana's former boyfriend, the character from the first film also returns in the first film he was played by Brad Flock.Superman III is a 1983 British superhero film directed by Richard Lester, based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the third film in the Superman film series and the last Superman film to be produced by Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind.

Superman III (1983) - IMDb, More comic-book than the first two.,vip_ebriega14,February/2007,5/10,"My Take: It never reaches the heights of its predecessors with its sillier story and ridiculous villains. Many consider this a weak entry in the Superman film series. Well, I thought it was at first. But when I watched it in numerous reruns, I began to like this. Christopher Reeve excellently reprises his role, alongside comedy favorite Richard Pryor, as a computer-whiz, who is hired by his boss to help fulfill his plans for world domination. Pryor may not do it right sometimes, but he's admittedly hilarious in spots. But painfully ridiculous in some. Among the things that make it a bit unsatisfying for critics is the lack of the characters from the originals. Lois lane had to go on vacation, so Lana Lang (played well by Annette O'Toole)is Superman's/Clark Kent's love interest. Robert Vaughn plays a sinister mastermind, an okay replacement for the famous villain Lex Luther. What some viewers don't understand is that director Richard Lester wants it to be more of a comic book adventure rather than what scriptwriter Mario Puzo did in the first two.

Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) - IMDb, The End of an Era... for Christopher Reeve,gavin694220,September/2006,6/10,"In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired?

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) - IMDb, I love it - An underrated solid action fun sequel from my childhood!,ivo-cobra826,February/2016,6/10,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III in my opinion it is a underrated solid good sequel to the original flick. Everyone hates this film and going for the second film. This one get's the crap for it and the second one gets the praised. This film was actually the first film in the trilogy that I have watched. As child I wanted so badly to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the original movie it was my biggest childhood wish, I heard that Splinter throw Shredder off the roof, I didn't know in which movie that was, so my mom bought me Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III on VHS in 1993, when this movie come out. The VHS sadly had a terrible picture quality and awful sound but even with all that I still liked the film not seeing the first two films. But after watching the first two films, they both become my favorite films, but I hated this one because there was no Shredder, Rocksteady, Bebop, Foot clan or Krang in this movie, that was than. I was really surprised by this film. They don't use jokes in here, they try too, but they aren't cartoonish like are in the second one. They actually use weapons and swords, nunchakus, not their fists they are Ninja Turtles so they are using weapons which I love that. The only thing that hurt the film are the costumes they aren't Jim Henson's Creature Shop, they are more cheap costumes that were provided by Effects Company the animatronics, that is a minor flaw. Plot: The four turtles travel back in time to the days of the legendary and deadly samurai in ancient Japan, where they train to perfect the art of becoming one. The turtles also assist a small village in an uprising.It is my childhood film. I love that the story is original, no one brings back the characters who died back again. Elias Koteas reprise his role back as Casey Jones and he also plays another character Whit a double spy by Walker's army. There is less humor in this film and it is more serious. Turtles are using there weapons. Leonardo is a bad ass. Fighting Japanese Samurai was awesome. I love that Turtles are back in the time in ancient old Japan, where the air was more cleaner, than it is today. I love Stuart Wilson as the villain Walker. A year later he was another villain in Lethal Weapon 3. Seriously I don't see the hate for this film I love it a lot! I love that Elias Koteas plays two double roles, one as Casey Jones and the second one as Whit. Again a lot of people are complaining because Casey Jones doesn't do anything in the film, just sit around, really? Seriously? Haven't you watched the movie? Whit (Elias Koteas) kills Waalker on the end of the film, when he fires a fire ball on Walker, while he try's to escape. Leonardo defeats Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono) in a sword fight, even tough the scene was hilarious I still have enjoy it. I love the music score and song Tarzan Boy by Baltimora and of course Rockin' Over The Beat by Technotronic. Paige Turco did outstanding performance as April O'Neil much better than she did in The secret of the Ooze. I grew up with this movie as a child a lot, I have even had Michelangelo and Walker's toy's, I Think I even had a Raphael figure I am not sure. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is a 1993 American action comedy film based on the comic book characters the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It is the second sequel to the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. Overall: I love this movie it get's 6 by me, I love Ninja Turtles in here, I love how Michelangelo saves a child from a flammable house and Leonardo saves him from dying, by giving him a mouth to mouth and he saves him. So why would I hate this film? when the effects are good and the acting is solid. Turtles saved and they prevented the war, they help people out. I think this film for me personally is better than second one and the reboot.

And, embarrassingly enough, I was sort of a fan of the second one. But this one...Okay, first off, there's NO fluid movement to the Turtles AT ALL. They look about as mechanically-enhanced as those crappy singing robots they used to have at your local Chuck E. Cheese. In several shots, you can actually SEE where the turtle mask ends and the body suit begins, thereby magically creating the illusion that this is a guy in a turtle costume. The Splinter costume/puppet/whatever is SO. BAD. In the first movie, he was nuanced and realistic, but I guess that's why the folks at Jim Henson's Creature Shop make so much. Apparently, New Line couldn't afford them anymore.The plot is... SO ridiculous. The ""writers"" send the Turtles BACK IN TIME to ancient Japan(?), a place where they don't have any villains from the comics or the cartoon. Some Japanese guys switch places with them in the present to be baby-sat by Casey Jones, and fish-out-of-water hilarity ensues (HA HA HA kill me). I actually have a theory about this: I think someone dug through a bunch of crappy action movie scripts, found one that would work with the Turtles and wrote the Turtles into it. It's the only thing that makes sense to me.And P.S. -- the ""jokes"" are... not.Anyway, avoid this abomination at all costs.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) - IMDb, The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite,ivo-cobra86,January/2018,10/10,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",1,"[terminator, judgment, day, best, action, flick, movie, ever, make, time, terminator, personal, favorite, film, absolutely, love, movie, death, number, best, movie, ever, till, today, best, best, epic, movie, time, nominate, movie, franchise, nominate, oscar, watch, carefully, follow, story, never, get, bore, entertain, movie, kick, as, love, hospital, scene, mostly, night, cyberdyne, building, action, sequence, course, steel, mill, action, sequence, perfect, film, film, deal, lot, action, involves, lot, paradox, past, travel, lot, explosion, automatic, weapon, use, movie, use, well, thousand, bullet, fire, explosive, projectile, fire, police, car, arnold, schwarzenegger, good, terminator, awesome, terrific, real, job, act, believably, one, best, character, ever, ...]","[terminator, judgment day, is, is, the best action, sci-fi flick movie, from, ever made, of, all time, terminator, is, my personal favorite film i, absolutely, love, this movie, to, death, is, my number 1 best movie, ever, till, today, best, of, the best epic movie, of, all time, was nominated, for, 4.oscars, the only movie, of, the franchise, was nominated, for, an oscar, if, you, watch, carefully, follow, the story you, never got bored, you, are very entertained, this movie, kicks, ass, i, love, the hospital scenes, mostly, at, night, the cyberdyne building action sequences, of, course steel mill action sequences, are, perfect, for, this film, this film deals, with, a lot, of, action, sci-fi, does involves, a lot, of, paradox past travel, is, a lot, of, explosions and automatic weapons, used, in, the movie, they, are used, well thousands, of, bullets, are fired, explosive projectiles, are fired, at, the police cars, arnold schwarzenegger, as, the good terminator t-800, did, an awesome terrific real job, he, acted, believably, as, of, his best characters, ...]",-0.07930338453037322,0.049823078934120336,1,1,3

The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002) - IMDb," I was prepared to hate this... But ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" was a Pleasant Surprise!",MaximumMadness10,January/2011,7/10,"3.7. A 3.7 out of 10. As I sit here, writing this review, this film has a user-average rating of 3.7 out of 10. I'm going out on a limb here, and assume that there are many people who blindly voted low scores to bring down the rating, based solely on the negative publicity. Because, I honestly can't believe that they all witnessed the same film I did. (Not to mention, mass negative voting from people who haven't seen the film is a problem here for movies with hype or notoriety.)I knew the story, I heard about it all. The film was shelved for two years, didn't get much publicity, and was released August of 2002. Releasing a major comedy with a huge budget 2 years after completion, with little publicity on almost the exact date of the 1-year anniversary of one of the biggest tragedies to ever hit the US... Seriously, did the studio even think when they tried to push this film out? I can only assume not. Critics crucified it. Audiences ignored it. It was a flop.I went along, blindly following the notion that because it flopped, it sucked. (Although, I have found out that many great films flopped, among them ""It's a Wonderful Life."") Finally a few months ago, a friend of mine said: ""Hey Adam, let's watch 'Pluto Nash'! It's on NetFlix!"" I scoffed, but after he persisted, I agreed.I'm glad I did.""Pluto Nash"" was refreshingly entertaining, and in no way was it the abysmal slight against cinema I had been told it was.The film centers on Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy in a fun performance), his sidekick robot Bruno (Randy Quaid in perhaps my favorite performance in the film) and Dina Lake (the astonishingly beautiful Rosario Dawson), with numerous other actors in supporting roles. Nash is the owner the nightclub ""Club Nash"", on the moon, some time in the future. He bought the club to save the life of a friend (Jay Mohr), who has since become a famous ""singer"" in a snazzy upscale part of the moon, leaving Nash behind. Dina arrives, hoping to work for Nash in order to earn money to buy her way back to Earth.Soon, henchmen sent by the mysterious Rex Crater arrive, interested in buying Nash's club. When Nash turns them down, they destroy the place. Nash, Dina and Bruno vow to discover who this Rex Carter is, and stop him.And so begins this fun action/comedy/sci-fi feature. In all honesty, the story is cliché, but it actually works quite well. This isn't supposed to be a revolutionary masterpiece, it's meant to be a fun good-guys-VS-bad-guys-buddy-movie type film, only set on the moon in the future. The characters are quite endearing and likable as well. They feel like people you'd want to hang out with.The special effects (which were unfairly criticized at the time) are surprisingly good, considering they were from 2000 (remember, the film was finished but shelved for two years), and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Visually, the film is a treat.The cast works. Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin.The music is fun, the editing is great, the set design is exquisite, the acting is generally very good, the direction is fantastic, the story is decent enough. I really can't say much. The craftsmanship is very competent. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination from any conceivable way you look at it. Is it a particularly strong film? No. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? Yes, it is most definitely. I also admire the fact that this film isn't ashamed of being light-hearted and positive. A lot of films (especially these days) try to be dark and gritty. It's nice to see just a positive, fun film.I honestly can't understand how this was so hated by critics upon release, and so ignored by the general public. It's a very fun movie, and I had a blast watching it. I will gladly be buying this flick sometime soon, and sharing it with others, so they can finally see this treat they missed out on.I give ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" a good 7 out of 10.

The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) - IMDb," ""You Speak Treason""................................""Fluently""",bkoganbing16,June/2006,10/10,"Although my personal favorite among Errol Flynn's films is The Sea Hawk, most will argue that his career role was this one in The Adventures of Robin Hood. It certainly has a deserved enduring popularity that's lasted for generations.Just about every version of the Robin Hood legend from Douglas Fairbanks's silent classic to the one in 1997 with Kevin Costner, deals with the same story facts. A young nobleman, deprived of his lands and title by Prince John and his cohorts, takes to Sherwood Forest and gathers a band which practices their own form of financial leveling. Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor until the day comes when good King Richard the Lionhearted comes back from the Crusades and sets things right.Were there ever a more attractive and idealistic a pair of young lovers on the screen than Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland? If there were, I'd be hard pressed to name them. They did eight films together from 1935 to 1941 and this one is probably the best. Errol all dash and charm and shy and retiring Olivia who just lights up the screen with beauty and romance.Directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley photographed this in some gorgeous technicolor. And they put together an almost perfect cast. You can't tell at all which scenes were directed by Curtiz and which by Keighley so seamless is the film's fabric.The small roles are truly memorable. The best comic moments in the film come from Melville Cooper, the not quite so bold Sheriff of Nottingham and from Herbert Mundin and Una O'Connor as Much the Miller's Son from Robin Hood's band and DeHavilland's maid. Herbert Mundin was the first one in this cast to die, he was killed in an automobile accident just two years after this film was finished. He was a funny little man who played nervous types, a kind of English Don Knotts. But in what was probably his career role, he literally decides the fate of English history here in a superb act of bravery. We expect bravery and courage from the Errol Flynns on the screen, but Mundin's performance shows the virtue can be found in some of us you wouldn't expect. His is my favorite performance apart from the leads.Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains make a superb pair of villains as Prince John and Guy of Gisborne. Rains covets the throne and Rathbone covets Olivia. They both provide the right touch of menace and make their performances real.As I write this Olivia DeHavilland is the last surviving member of this classic film. During her career she fought hard with her studio to get roles where she would be more than the crinoline heroine waiting for her man to finish his brave deeds. She knew her worth and talent and got a pair of Oscars to prove it.Back in the day DeHavilland dismissed films like The Adventures of Robin Hood. But several years back she attended a revival of both The Adventures of Robin Hood and Dodge City two very different type films she did with Errol Flynn.As she watched it she saw the reverence and respect the audience had for both of these classics. When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now, she was real proud to have been associated with these films.You have every reason to be proud Olivia. And we're real proud of you.",1,"[although, personal, favorite, among, errol, flynn, film, sea, hawk, argue, career, role, one, adventure, robin, hood, certainly, deserve, endure, popularity, last, every, version, robin, hood, legend, douglas, fairbanks, silent, classic, one, kevin, costner, deal, story, fact, young, nobleman, deprive, land, title, prince, john, cohort, take, sherwood, forest, gather, band, practice, form, financial, leveling, rob, rich, give, poor, day, come, good, king, richard, lionhearted, come, back, crusade, set, thing, ever, attractive, idealistic, pair, young, lover, screen, errol, flynn, olivia, dehavilland, would, hard, press, name, eight, film, together, one, probably, best, errol, dash, charm, shy, retire, olivia, light, screen, beauty, michael, curtiz, ...]","[although, my personal favorite, among, errol flynn, films, is, the sea hawk, most will argue, that, his career role, was, in, the adventures, of, robin hood, it, certainly has, deserved enduring, popularity, is lasted, for, generations.just, about, every version, of, the robin hood legend, from, douglas fairbanks, silent classic, to, in, with, kevin costner, deals, with, the same story facts, a young nobleman, deprived, of, his lands and title, by, prince john and his cohorts, takes, to, sherwood, forest, gathers, a band, which practices their, own form, of, financial leveling, robbing, from, rich, giving, to, the poor, until, the day, comes, when, good king richard, lionhearted comes, back, from, the crusades, sets things, right.were, ever, more attractive, idealistic, a pair, of, young lovers, on, the screen, than, errol flynn and olivia dehavilland, if, were, i, would be hard pressed, to, name, them, they, did, eight films, together, from, to, is, probably, best, errol, all dash, charm, shy, retiring, ...]",-0.13592080913185686,-0.02276923667359417,1,1,1
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005) - IMDb, Good for kids,Anthony_Boyd15,June/2005,8/10,"Well, I didn't like it. Or, at the least what I mean is that I just saw a movie with tons of plot-holes, childish themes, and so on. However, you better believe my kids loved it. My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch, even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film. She said she wants to be Lavagirl for Halloween.If you're 16+ this movie is a loser. You won't like it, and that explains all the low scores you're seeing here. This movie just isn't for adults.

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005) - IMDb, Most perplexing viewing experience of my life.,gilbert_gumphrey18,April/2006,5/10,"I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.Sharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple, childish, and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship, and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie, especially in the end, I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart, much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.I have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised, obviously, and I had a lot of fun watching the movie (I'm excluding the terrible 3-D version of the film, which is a pointless distract-or and takes away a lot of the magic). Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 (a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1)? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved - it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly, the special effects are slapdash, the editing is at times incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.So I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I, a 17 year old classic film lover, enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids, especially boys (for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film) will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young, you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia, you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know - you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.Or maybe not.",0,"[remember, last, time, movie, confuse, torment, filmgoing, soul, much, movie, everything, inside, everything, love, shawshank, redemption, vertigo, rag, bull, great, great, great, classic, movie, tell, sharkboy, lavagirl, awful, drastically, awful, enjoy, almost, every, minute, let, try, explain, way, write, ongoing, list, great, film, ever, make, bad, film, ever, make, sharkboy, lavagirl, movie, ever, see, gotten, placement, list, young, child, name, max, dream, wonderful, fantasy, adolescent, superhero, type, adventure, eventually, travel, dream, world, aid, aforementioned, sharkboy, lavagirl, fight, keep, dream, world, happy, go, lucky, place, evil, electric, story, simple, childish, bit, reminiscent, neverending, story, knew, plot, year, old, cousin, make, watch, ...]","[i, cannot remember, last, time, a movie, confused, tormented, my filmgoing soul, as much, as, this movie, did, everything, inside of, me, everything, in, me, loves, shawshank redemption and vertigo, raging, bull, all these great great great classic movies, tells, me, that, sharkboy and lavagirl, was, awful, it, was, drastically awful, i, enjoyed, almost, every minute, of, it, let, me, try, explain, it this way, i, have written, ongoing lists, of, the greatest films, ever made, the worst films, ever made, sharkboy, lavagirl, is, the only movie i, have ever seen, has gotten, a placement, in, both lists, for, is, about, a young child, named, max, dreams, up, wonderful fantasies, adolescent superhero type adventures, eventually, he, travels, into, this dream world, aided, by, the aforementioned sharkboy, lavagirl, as, they, fight, to, keep, the dream, world, a happy go, lucky place, from, the evil mr, electric, so, is, the story, simple, childish, a bit reminiscent, of, neverending, story, ...]",0.09514761013398403,0.2049022922559546,0,2,2
The Avengers (1998) - IMDb," Falling for the old ""edit out what the test audience didn't like"" trick",susannah-513,August/2001,7/10,"Oh, wait, that's from Get Smart, not The Avengers.No matter.  As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood), I will say, right off the bat, that this movie did not fail on all levels.  If nothing else, the makers of this film understood, at least, what The Avengers was about.  This puts them head and shoulders above, say, the makers of The Wild Wild West movie, who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.They might not have been successful in the execution, but they did understand what made The Avengers tick, and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing, we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.Two scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding:  When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase, and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles.  Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.Whatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old ""edit out what the test audience didn't like"" trick, and put a botched film on the screen.

The Avengers (1998) - IMDb, A wasted opportunity,MartinK7531,May/2006,3/10,"Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says ""how now brown cow?"" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.",0,"[avenger, good, film, bad, film, ever, make, first, saw, movie, cinema, upon, release, time, think, one, bad, film, would, see, point, watch, time, since, opinion, improve, well, slightly, rate, apart, pervade, incoherence, think, film, major, problem, slightness, hour, half, long, plot, simplistic, say, least, hard, imagine, audience, feel, bit, first, come, especially, film, summer, blockbuster, another, big, problem, cast, uma, thurman, emma, peel, thurman, show, fine, actress, movie, pulp, fiction, look, depth, never, believe, scientist, second, english, accent, sound, natural, nicole, kidman, role, first, offer, would, surely, better, particular, displayed, flawless, english, accent, film, others, hour, english, actress, also, think, ...]","[is, avengers, a good film, is, it the worst film, ever made, i first, saw, the movie, at, the cinema, upon, its release, at that, time, i, did think, that, it, was, of, the worst films, i would seen, up to that, point, i, have watched, it 2 or 3 times, since, then, my opinion, of, it, has improved, well, very slightly, at, any rate, apart, from, a pervading incoherence, i, think, the film, major problem, is, its slightness, it, is, only, an hour, a half, long, the plot, is, very simplistic, to, say, least, it, is, not hard, to, imagine, audiences, feeling, a bit, short-changed, when, it first, came, out, especially, as, the film, was, a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster, another big problem, is, the casting, of, uma thurman, as, emma peel, thurman, has shown, herself, to, be, a fine actress, in, movies, such, as, pulp fiction but she, just looks, out of, her depth, here, ...]",-0.11526514210871323,0.1848938532943574,1,1,3
The Avengers (2012) - IMDb, Bad-ass descent-amazing superhero MCU action flick defenders of the earth my favorite,ivo-cobra82,July/2017,10/10,"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films.

The Avengers (2012) - IMDb, Are movies so bad now that a film like this is considered great?,thefilmexpert30,April/2012,1/10,"Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of ""The Matrix"" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in ""The Avengers""? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from ""The Dark Knight.""Gangster films before ""The Godfather"" were just pulp. ""The Godfather"" transcended the genre just as ""Unforgiven"" did with Westerns. The same is true about ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that ""The Avengers"" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as ""The Avengers"" is? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made ""Psycho"" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. And do I even have to go into how voting to give ""The Avengers"" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Citizen Kane"", ""Vertigo,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""8 1/2,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.Though I've brought up some films that are darker than ""The Avengers"" or more serious, that is not my complaint about ""The Avengers"" at all. ""Star Wars, "" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like ""The Avengers"" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put ""The Avengers"" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. Go watch ""The Avengers"" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, ""The Avengers"" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. Oh wait a sec. I just learned that there's a movie based on ""Battleship""--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare ""The Avengers"" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.Never mind...",0,"[movie, become, bad, day, merely, totally, formulaic, film, like, avenger, herald, exceptional, film, sure, film, hit, mark, good, expect, film, refresh, new, star, war, obvious, flaw, provide, us, totally, new, universe, unique, political, conflict, world, even, theology, force, first, mostly, watch, story, robotic, english, dandy, argue, chirp, roll, trashcan, amazingly, enough, lucas, make, unique, crazy, idea, entertain, plot, avenger, comic, book, compare, plot, inception, matrix, even, back, future, good, bad, ugly, much, make, film, great, plot, highly, innovative, idea, go, always, know, exactly, avenger, go, along, line, psycho, empire, strike, back, matrix, etc, provide, classic, twist, norman, go, insane, mind, ...]","[have, movies, become so bad, these days, that, a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like, the avengers, is heralded, as, an exceptional film?sure, this film, hits, all the marks, has, some good one-liners, once, we, expected, films, to, be, refreshing and new, star wars, while, having, obvious flaws, provided, us a totally new universe, with, its own unique political conflicts, worlds, even, its, own theology, the force, its first twenty-minutes, is mostly watching, the story, of, robotic english dandy, c3-p0, argue, with, chirping rolling, trashcan, r2-d2, amazingly enough lucas, made, that, unique and, crazy idea, entertaining, the plot, of, the avengers, is, just, your, run-of-the-mill comic book, story-line, compare, its plot, to that of, inception, the matrix, even, back, to, the future, the good, the bad, the ugly, much, of, makes, those films, so, great, is, that, their plots, are, highly innovative, you, have, no idea, where, they, are going, you, always know, exactly where, the avengers, is going, along, these same lines, psycho, the empire strikes, back, ...]",-0.10687966519042136,0.1757729352357206,1,1,3
The Bourne Identity (2002) - IMDb," Hooray for decent, more realistic spy films!",Sleel17,March/2003,8/10,"I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in ""Ronin"" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.",1,"[grown, extremely, tire, typical, formula, spy, film, like, bond, juvenile, stunt, exhibition, triple, x, bare, handful, spy, film, feature, relatively, realistic, spy, thriller, especially, recently, concentration, spectacular, movie, less, substance, cotton, bourne, identity, ronin, recent, spy, movie, think, feature, skydive, bungie, jumping, skiing, downhill, shoot, innumerable, bad, guy, laser, pen, car, ejection, seat, silicone, breast, woman, name, would, vaguely, embarrass, say, front, mother, crap, pass, espionage, film, plot, reason, exist, meet, quota, explosion, cleavage, order, draw, summer, action, film, bourne, particularly, deep, plot, consistent, focus, focus, entirely, upon, bourne, deal, memory, past, hunt, without, know, people, complain, confuse, movie, one, ...]","[i, have grown extremely tired, of, the typical formula spy film, like, bond, the juvenile stunt exhibition, triple, have been, a bare handful, of, spy films, that, feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently, with, a concentration, on, spectacular movies, have, less substance, than, cotton candy.besides, the bourne identity, ronin, is, the only other recent spy movie i, can think, of, did, not feature, skydiving, bungie, jumping, skiing, downhill, while, shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars, with, ejection seats, silicone, breasted, women, with, names you, would be vaguely embarrassed, to, say, in, front, of, your mother, most, of, the crap, passes, for, an espionage film, has, no plot, reason, for, existing, other, than, to, meet, a quota, of, explosions and cleavage, in, order, to, draw, the summer action film, crowd.while, bourne, does not have, a particularly deep plot, it, is, consistent, focused, the focus, is, entirely, upon, bourne, how, he, is, to, deal, with, having, no memory, of, his, ...]",-0.03181613409401068,0.03152263762998339,1,1,1
The Breath (2009) - IMDb, The unspoken aspects war,lefaikone28,January/2010,9/10,"I was browsing the reviews of ""Nefes"", and since there was only a handful of reviews by non-Turkish IMDb users - since it hasn't been screened much outside Turkey - I felt that I had to give my effort to it. Having said that, I feel that it's been badly misunderstood by many people. Many reviewers judged it as ""propaganda"" or ""morally corrupted"" etc. I couldn't disagree more.To me it wasn't even political, even less morally corrupted - disturbing and even revolting - yes. Corrupted - not even remotely. I might even call it pacifistic. The story is a deep and humane view in to the persona of a soldier. I don't say Turkish soldier, because the moral issues of it are so universal - basically the story could be placed in any war throughout the modern history.**Minor spoiler* Most of the critic on IMDb were about the parts were the Turkish special forces (the main characters) were shown doing unjustified violence to their unarmed prisoner. That's the ""morally corrupted propaganda"" part I guess. The way I see it, it's as anti-propaganda as it gets. It puts the main characters to same line as their enemies. It doesn't try to glorify or justify either sides part on the situation.

The first of these adverts is when the film lead stops to buy a drink of coke for no reason and proceeds to slowly drink it with the can taking up most of the screen, really just like an advert.This was a little annoying but I kept hope that this was a small issue in what could become a very good film. Unfortunitly it didn't and car and phone adverts continued through the film. The script was poor and events unbelievable. Most of the action scenes you will have seen copied from Bourne or other action movies but made laughably similar but much worse. The acting from weaver was poor, although I am not sure if the blame lies with sigourney or the director.

The Crow: City of Angels (1996) - IMDb," ""Wrong place, at the wrong time""",lost-in-limbo4,May/2008,4/10,"I adore the original film that starred Brandon Lee as the avenging angel brought back from the dead. Now a sequel was probably inevitable, and I remember being largely disappointed by it with its wearily cut-up story, dour performances and diluted action. Well nothing has changed the second time around. Again I can't knock that killer hard-rock / industrial sounding soundtrack, haunting score and the dark, Gothic embellishment creating an atmospherically catastrophe post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. It's dirty, smoggy and jarringly bleak. Jean Yves Escoffier's cinematography lenses it with the right free-spirited. However there's nothing overly memorable, or even powerfully gripping to draw any real emotion and interest form the suffocatingly drab and unimaginative narrative. By following the same patterns of the original's tragedy, it doesn't lay any new groundwork. It was a tediously repetitive mess that seemed more fantasy-based and conjures up a script that's weakly penned. Vincent Perez's avenging soul is unconvincingly void in a tortured performance, which doesn't create much heart-ache or grace. There's no imprint, or witty charisma that Lee evoked. Honestly I didn't feel anything. Richard Brooks flimsily strolls by with no impressionable stance as the head villain. Mia Kirshner gives a sound performance and Iggy Pop delightfully chews up the scenery to spit it out. Director Tim Pope can formulate some flourishing visuals and lasting poses, but when it came to setting everything in motion. Flat and unexciting comes to mind. His action set-pieces lacked zest and seemed to plod like they're sliced up music video clips. Never did it infuse any real sense of energy, thrills and urgency.

The Crow: Salvation (2000) - IMDb," Not the best, but worth a look.",The,Garthster20/January,7/10,"I love ""The Crow,"" and there's not much in my mind that could be done in a sequel to top it. ""Salvation,"" unlike ""City of Angels,"" doesn't try to top the first one, or rip it off... The characters are solid, the performances are great, and the action is non-stop. But what singles this movie out is the story. It's a good story, not just another ""Crow"" movie. The direction of the film reminds me of the first, very dark, yet crisp (not gritty like the 2nd), and the trick camera angles mixed with the impressive special effects keep the supernatural elements alive as the very human story rolls along.I work at a video store, and I see all kinds of movies that bypass theatres and come direct to video, and usually there's something about them that tells you why, even the good ones. This had the look and feel of something that, if released at the appropriate time, would have done well in the theatres. It wouldn't have been a smash hit, and it certainty wouldn't bring in as many people as the original did, but it deserves much better than this.If you're fans of the franchise, I highly recommend that you see this.

It wasn't the actors, because they actually did a decent job. It wasn't the director, because it seemed like he knew what he was doing. It was the plot, plain and simple, the plot. First off, Corvis turning into the crow? No, didn't work for me. I didn't feel for these characters at all to tell the truth. The script didn't develop them as well as the first ""Crow"" did. So that was a major problem, I didn't feel that Corvis and Lauren had a strong love because they repeatedly showed the same loving scene between them. ""Was that their only romantic moment?"" I thought. See, the first ""Crow"" showed many memories of Shelly and Eric that were loving and touching, it showed how much they loved each other and it would never die.Another problem I had was the make up was naturally on Corvis and didn't give any depth to his anger on the murder of his girlfriend. Kirsten Dunst seemed really out of place and was just another copy off of Sarah from the first ""Crow"".

We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie.

Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film.

The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - IMDb," Lazy, incoherent, and unsatisfying on nearly every level.",seniorlimpio26,July/2012,1/10,"What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great, right?!?! How could Nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! Well, I'll tell you...Bruce Wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies, but from the comic as well. Catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak, flat, and forced. For a movie that's almost three hours long, you only get about 20 minutes of Batman in costume (if you're lucky). The movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing, but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature. As for more heavily SPOILERY observations...Commissioner Gordon is barely in the movie, spending most his time injured in a hospital, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the Commissioner to be doing... solution- COMBINE THE TWO CHARACTERS!!! The two Batman vs. Bane fights are flat and boring as hell. Bane is a cardboard, unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous cliché plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing, wanna-be-tender, totally out-of-place, extremely laughable scenes I've ever seen in my life- HE FRIGGIN' CRIES?!!?!? Every single, yes EVERY SINGLE cop in Gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that Bane's raising a secret army, only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. Reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the U.S. government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.The ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd Act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to Bane CRYING), and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.After the 2nd lame Bats/Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to not just like this, but LOVE it, but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because I can't believe the director of The Dark Knight and the masterpiece that is Inception was responsible for this movie. It's lazy and uninspired to the point of being offensive to everyone who's ever been not just a Batman fan, but a fan of non- intelligence-insulting movies.",0,"[make, thing, bad, predecessor, basically, intricate, work, genius, tdkr, lack, essentially, everything, make, dark, knight, particularly, one, great, superhero, movie, ever, produce, top, everyone, bandwagoning, think, great, suppose, great, right, could, nolan, finale, masterpiece, well, tell, bruce, wayne, act, first, two, movie, comic, well, catwoman, motivation, place, story, weak, flat, force, movie, almost, three, hour, long, get, minute, batman, costume, lucky, movie, jump, weird, time, increment, mildly, confuse, mostly, force, facilitate, want, epic, nature, heavily, spoilery, observation, commissioner, gordon, barely, movie, spending, time, injured, hospital, joseph, character, come, blue, would, expect, commissioner, combine, two, character, two, batman, bane, fight, flat, ...]","[makes, things, worse, is, that, its predecessors, were, basically intricate works, of, genius, tdkr, lacks, essentially everything, that, made, the dark knight, particularly, of, the greatest superhero movies, ever produced, on, top, of, everyone, bandwagoning, on, thinking, it, is, great, because, it, is, supposed, to, be, great, right, how, could nolan, finale, not be, a masterpiece, well, i, will tell, you...bruce wayne acts, out-of-character, from, not just, first, two movies, from, the comic, as, well, catwoman, motivation and place, in, the story, is, weak, flat, forced, for, a movie, is, almost, three hours, long, you, only get, about, 20 minutes, of, batman, in, costume, if, you, are, lucky, the movie jumps, in, weird time increments, are, mildly confusing, mostly forced, to, facilitate, its, want, to-be epic nature, as for, more heavily spoilery, observations...commissioner gordon, is, barely, in, the movie, ...]",0.04057166120186848,-0.04131583622340635,0,0,0
The Darkest Hour (2011) - IMDb, A fun alien invasion film without much pretentiousness,GTeixeira8,October/2013,6/10,"While maybe not much better than what the ratings and reviews say, at the very least 'The Darkest Hour' has the fun factor going for it. There is not much for a plot: your typical alien invasion, where a group of survivors have to try and survive the attack while in Moscow.Wait, Moscow?One of the things I liked here was that there IS originality. Instead of another American city, or even Tokyo/London, this time around we watch Moscow under attack. Instead of having to see the characters running and hiding around the same New York for the nth time, we are presented an 'unknown' scenario that has a lot of charm going for it.Another plus is the aliens themselves. Not your typical armor-wearing soldiers or 'greys', but in here they have a very original design (bodyless masses of light). It is sad to hear the clichèd excuse for their invasion, but they are very interesting to see.Despite these flairs of originality, overall the film suffers from the typical B-movie sci-fi problems. The blandness of the cast and some logic-defying situations/developments (every Russian they meet speak perfect English, for example) are downsides, but the straight-forward plot, lack of an overly pretentious message and non-boring development more than compensate.Overall, this is far from a great film but it is a fun straight-forward B-movie with some welcome flashes of originality.

The Darkest Hour (2011) - IMDb, A Nutshell Review: The Darkest Hour,DICK,STEEL21/December,3/10,"Granted I wasn't expecting a great deal from The Darkest Hour, where the trailers have probably spelt out the entire film from beginning to end, and more than validated it to be nothing but a special effects extravaganza. Then again, what you have already seen is it, as The Darkest Hour indeed is the darkest in terms of filmmaking, having nothing else served up to excite nor to thrill, sticking to what would be a rote storyline packaged hundreds of times over.The selling point of the film is of course Timur Bekmambetov's name on the credits, a filmmaker who had made everyone sit up and take notice of his inventive, stylish science fiction films out of Russia - Night Watch and Day Watch - that Hollywood had come wooing, and from then on it's either producer creds to help boost some languishing production, or allowing the filmmaker to helm his own like in Wanted. Not everything he touches turns to gold of course, and sadly The Darkest Hour boasted what could have been something he could have done, but ultimately falling very flat on its face because of the lack of freshness in its story, written by Leslie Bohem, M.T. Ahem and Jon Spaihts, who also had screenplay responsibilities.The premise is as bland as you can get, and frankly can work in any other major city if not for the exoticness of Moscow, and Bekmambetov's connection of course. The characters too can be anyone other than the software engineering duo Sean (Emile Hirsch) and Ben (Max Minghella) who flew halfway across the world to find out they were outplayed by their Swedish competitor Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), and two holidaying teenage girls Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and Anne (Rachael Taylor), who all got together in a hip pub, only for what could have led to respective one night stands interrupted by a parade of lights falling from the sky, which from the trailer you will know contain some mean, invisible aliens out to annihilate all of humankind for our energy.Yes you read that right, invisible aliens. They have this innate ability to light up bulbs activate anything that's run by electricity, since it's a signature they carry, before being allowed to reveal something extra in the final few scenes. Sure, something invisible would work in playing up our fears, but the way director Chris Gorak did it, his inexperience shows. Similar genre films like Attack The Block built anticipation nicely, but here we get nothing of that sort of emotional engagement, as it teases through elements that suggest vulnerability and chinks in the adversary's armour, force fields of sorts that are entirely resistant to whatever arsenal us humans can throw at it, if we can get to realize their positions first.The plot could have been written by any newbie hack sent packing home to watch countless of alien invasion and monster movies, to be able to come up with something that's really quite plain and lacking true suspense. In some ways it's like an amalgamation of science fiction films from I am Legend to other contemporary alien invasion type movies, except that we don't give a hoot too much for the characters involved here, so much so that the filmmakers have the audacity and courage to ensure equal opportunity to become alien fodder, which is a rarity.Effects wise, this two trick pony will soon wear out its novelty, the first of which is the way the aliens turn humans and all living creatures into swirling dust upon contact, and the second of which is an electrical whip-like probe that goes feeling around for lifeforms. Nothing terribly original here, and after a while these limited bag of tricks do become a little stale. As for its 3D presentation, there's only depth of field, getting human dust falling all over, as well as having exploding debris hurtle toward the screen. Some large scale effects like collapsing walls and huge probes to siphon Earth's resources still looked a little bit raw,Perhaps then if you're looking for any sliver of merit to watch this, it will be for the on- location shoots in Russia, as well as having this film mark what would be a rare treat at having Russian soldiers/mercenaries in action up against the enemy compared to the usual US led war machinery in any alien invasion film, and this one also marking a USA-Russia collaboration amongst survivors in this post-cold war era. But you need not have to look that deep into this film, because it's indeed a struggle to find something unique and of narrative quality, failing which The Darkest Hour is only at best a mediocre film that offers nothing new.",0,"[grant, expect, great, deal, darkest, hour, trailer, probably, spelt, entire, film, begin, end, validate, nothing, special, effect, extravaganza, already, see, darkest, hour, indeed, darkest, term, filmmaking, nothing, else, serve, excite, thrill, stick, would, rote, storyline, package, hundred, time, sell, point, film, course, timur, bekmambetov, name, credit, filmmaker, make, everyone, sit, take, notice, inventive, stylish, science, fiction, film, russia, night, watch, day, watch, hollywood, come, woo, either, producer, cred, help, boost, languish, production, allow, filmmaker, helm, like, want, everything, touch, turn, gold, course, sadly, darkest, hour, boast, could, something, could, do, ultimately, fall, flat, face, lack, freshness, story, write, leslie, bohem, ...]","[granted, i, was not expecting, a great deal, from, the darkest hour, where, the trailers, have, probably spelt, the, entire film, from, beginning, to, end, more, than, validated, it, to, be nothing, a special effects, extravaganza, then again, you, have already seen is, it, as, the darkest hour, indeed is, darkest, in, terms, of, filmmaking, having, nothing, else served up, to, excite, to, thrill, sticking, to, would be, a rote storyline, packaged, hundreds, of, times over.the selling point, of, the film is, of, course timur bekmambetov, name, on, the credits, a filmmaker, had made, everyone sit, up, take, notice, of, his, inventive, stylish science fiction films, out of, russia, night watch and day watch, that, hollywood, had come wooing, from, then, on, it, is, either producer creds, to, help, boost some languishing production, allowing, the filmmaker, to, helm, his, own, like, wanted, not everything he, touches turns, to, gold, of, course, sadly, the darkest hour, boasted, ...]",-0.10837999932304239,0.07357498548965774,1,1,3
The General (1926) - IMDb, The Genius of Buster Keaton,MadReviewer17,April/2001,9/10,"Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn't be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.  
`The General' is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton  or, for that matter, a silent film  go find this one and watch it.  It's a classic.

The Incredibles (2004) - IMDb, Charming and fun,basrutten24,December/2004,9/10,"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message.

The Incredibles (2004) - IMDb, Good movie...TERRIBLE messages,TensersFloatingDisk2,June/2005,3/10,"Movies don't just entertain -- they MEAN. They have messages. They instruct, influence, and evoke.So what is the meaning of _The_Incredibles_? Simple: You Don't Count.I am, perhaps, unusual in that I scrutinize every movie, TV show, newspaper story and advertisement for its deeper message -- but I think that practice is a lot more common when we consider media aimed at children, as this movie, with its toy tie-ins and McDonalds-driven marketing, most certainly is. So when friends suggested that Pixar had hit another one out of the park with _The_Incredibles_, I naturally screened it for my kid, thinking this would be a beauty.Imagine my shock and dismay to find that, underneath the comic-book overtones, this is not a movie for kids at all. Not only is the violence fast, furious, and rampant, it's deadly...as the characters themselves point out, Saturday Morning Cartoons offer kids an unrealistic belief that deadly violence is somehow fun. Well OK, I can get behind that message, but it's going to be tricky explaining to my six-year-old that when he sees a plane full of bad-guys blow up as it rips through a tree, that this isn't just metaphorical -- that guy is DEAD.But I got more and more disturbed when I saw that the majority of the violence in this movie wasn't being perpetrated by the bad guys at all -- it's mostly coming from our ""heroes,"" The Incredible family themselves. Mr. I. uproots trees, tosses bombs, knocks down buildings, and punches mere mortal villains with fists which we've seen lift train cars. And then, in a fit of pique, in an early establishing scene, Mr. Incredible punches his boss. Who is *NOT* a villain. He's an unarmed civilian, which Mr. Incredible outweighs by about 200 pounds. He punches this guy through several walls, and later views of this poor guy in the hospital make it clear that he's broken a lot of bones.This is our HERO???? And then there's the main message of the film: you don't count. You see you, me, all us non-super-heroes, we aren't ""special,"" like the Incredibles. And no, the idea that everyone has some special quality, that everyone has unique skills or traits, that's disdained by our hero as a ""celebration of mediocrity"" -- his normal job, like the one you and I have, you see that's not good enough for the special people. No, the special people should be given the opportunity to requisition government aircraft, to own supercars they haven't paid for, to throw civilians through walls without any consequence if they act annoying. In fact, the guy who suggests that everyone *could* be special or super, if given the chance, is the VILLAIN of the movie! So there goes about 2,000 years worth of morality, right down the drain.

The Iron Giant (1999) - IMDb," a masterpiece, plain and simple",dpenny29,December/1999,10/10,"I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.

The Last Airbender (2010) - IMDb, An 8 year old's assessment,mckee-783-6211926,July/2010,1/10,"I would like to share my son's review. He just turned 8 and dictated as his dad typed: I just hate it so bad!!!I'm a HUGE fan of the the cartoons. I have the whole series, including Water, Earth and Fire. It was a HUGE disappointment because even by the time I saw the commercial, I knew it would be completely crushing! I mean, the characters! Iroh was the greatest disappointment. He was not kind and wise enough. And also he was not old enough. And why can't they say anyone's name right!???I thought it was completely disrespectful to put the characters skin colors the opposite. After the first twenty minutes of it I was bored already but I have to say the effects were decent. And the Avatar did not have enough happiness in him! I think it's important to the movie. Aang is the main character of the movie, and he should at least get a little more happiness inside of him! When I got home that night I had to watch the cartoon series for some time to completely forget about the movie! And... actually, I'm watching it right now! If anybody wanted to see this movie I would suggest they close their eyes and ears!!!*********************Dad's two cents:My son became interested in Avatar the Last Air Bender, the animated series at age 4.I bought him the entire series on DVD as soon as the episodes were available and he and I devoured every episode, again and again. Compared to the magnificently crafted animated series, I'd have to say the live action movie was an abysmal embarrassment, a sophomoric and vapid display of ignorance. Go rent or buy the animated series instead. I think it's some of the best fiction ever written for children. It's incredible. It's an epic parable dealing with sophisticated philosophical, cultural, emotional and spiritual issues which have plagued human civilization since the emergence of reason. And it does it with lightheartedness and joy. The theme deals with no less than issues of greed, power, spirituality, and the formation of identity and moral values. It grapples with the ideals of pacifism. It teaches teamwork, compassion, empathy and humility. It exemplifies wisdom and the appreciation of art, nature and connectedness - connectedness to each other, to nature, to animals, to the universe, and emphasizes detachment from possession. The story line traverses goofy playfulness, tween and young teen crushes and love, family power dynamics, friendship, mental illness, and gut wrenching loss. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. But these things can't be achieved effectively without superb craftsmanship. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun, action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy. The live action version is NONE of these things. No insight, no depth of character, only the most cursory references of some of the core thematic values of the animated series, and those done so poorly as to come off as just... pathetically trite. The thing I find most upsetting regarding the failure of this movie to deliver is that the original animated series covers all of what I find to be the best of Eastern culture, and we Westerners need to understand these things in this global community. Buddhist and Confucian ideals and philosophies are front and center and, in my mind, are the greatest gifts the East has to offer the world, and the very things that are most clearly in danger of vanishing in the face of the West's insignificant obsession with material gain and conspicuous consumption.And another thing, too. It's typical that this story was handled on the level it was - dismissively. Adults appear to be largely disinterested in the profound turmoil in which children are engaged as they enter their teens. They are forming their value systems, they are trying to reconcile reality with fantasy and desire. They are trying to find the balance between selfishness and empathy. They are finding what it means to be themselves, members of a community, and a species on the planet. They are in agony grappling with issues we were happy to leave behind. But these struggles are never truly resolved, and our ideas of who we are and how we fit in the world cannot remain fixed, and, yet, when they are challenged, we adults consider ourselves to be in a state of crisis, when that is the perpetual state of being of a young teen. And I would argue it's a state of flux that we should never leave, that we should always be questioning ourselves, our figures of authority, and our place in the world and in relation to those around us. I do not see these struggles as juvenile, but human, and the animated series brings all these struggles to mind. Sadly, the movie did little to bring the richness of these struggles to life. In my most critical mood, I would say this failure is deeply offensive to my sensibilities as a human being.But on the other hand, not everyone has the depth of vision and creative genius to pull off what admittedly would be a very challenging feat. I just wish I could see what David Lean could have done with this story.",0,"[would, like, share, son, review, turn, dictate, dad, typed, hate, bad, huge, fan, cartoon, whole, series, include, water, earth, fire, huge, disappointment, even, time, saw, commercial, knew, would, completely, crush, mean, character, iroh, great, disappointment, kind, wise, enough, also, old, enough, say, anyone, name, right, thought, completely, disrespectful, put, character, skin, color, opposite, first, twenty, minute, bore, already, say, effect, decent, avatar, enough, happiness, think, important, movie, aang, main, character, movie, least, get, little, happiness, inside, get, home, night, watch, cartoon, series, time, completely, forget, movie, actually, watch, right, anybody, want, see, movie, would, suggest, close, eye, ear, two, cent, ...]","[i, would, like to, share, my son, review, he, just turned, dictated, as, his dad, typed, i, just hate, it so bad!!!i am, a huge fan, of, the the cartoons, i, have, the whole series, including, water, earth and fire, it, was, a huge disappointment, because, even, by, the time i, saw, the commercial, i, knew, it, would be completely crushing, i mean, the characters, iroh, was, the greatest disappointment, he, was, not kind, wise, enough, also, he, was, not old, enough, why, cannot, they, say, anyone, name right!???i, thought, it, was, completely disrespectful, to, put, the characters, skin colors, the opposite, after, first, twenty minutes, of, it, i was bored, already, i, have, to, say, the effects, were, decent, the avatar, did not have, enough happiness, in, him, i, think, it, is, important, to, the movie, aang, is, the main character, of, the movie, he, should at, ...]",-0.005280896070879839,-0.009598581076642755,1,0,1
The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002) - IMDb," A Fantastic Bio-pic on an Intriguing Figure, but Not Without Flaws",SURJYAKIRAN10,June/2002,10/10,"The Legend of Bhagat Singh is one of Indian cinema's most ambitious projects to date.  After three years of painstaking research and set construction, veteran film maker Raj Kumar Santoshi and actor Ajay Devgan shot the film in a short stretch of six months.  The film released early due to competition from other films dealing with roughly the same subject.  Overall it's a pretty solid film but one can't help shake the feeling that it could have been a far superior product if it had been worked on for a short while longer.The film tells the entire life story of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Bhagat Singh who, in a nut shell, grew disillusioned with Gandhi's passive movement and lead an independent violent struggle against the British.Colonial India is recreated magnificently in the film and the British atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by the director.  One can truly get a sense of how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters to violence and revolt.  Some of the film's strengths are its hard hitting portrayal of British atrocities, its court scenes and its action scenes.The film's biggest highlight is its lead performer, Indian actor Ajay Devgan.  The actor single handedly manages to uplift even the most dull and unconvincing scenes in the film to a high quality level.  His every expression and mannerism is carefully calculated to maximize his impact on the viewer.  This man can move audiences to tears or wide smiles with just a few short lines and quick glances from his intense eyes.  His work here is par excellence and can easily rival any work done by any grade-A actors the world over.The supporting cast is good as well, with fellow revolutionary Sukhdev (Indian stage actor Sushant Singh) Bhagat Singh's mother (Indian diva Farida Jalal) leaving lasting impressions as well.The last excellent thing about the movie is the music by renowned composer A.R. Rahman.  The music is not as festive as Bollywood movies usually boast, but that's to be expected considering the subject of the film.  The well crafted, soothing ethnic tunes manage to evoke the right emotions without seeming rash and distasteful.The film isn't without its weaknesses, however.  For one, it's obviously a rushed effort.  Segments of the script seem under developed and the impact of certain national tragedies on Bhagat Singh's mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them to be.Also, Bhagat Singh's political ideology (he was a communist, by the way) is never really spelled out for viewers.  Instead, they are left to put together pieces for themselves connecting the dots from dialogs and incidents in the film to really figure out the main character's mindset and view points.The second half of the film moves at an awkward pace, sometimes lingering on minute details and other times racing ahead and skipping crucial events (which are referenced in later dialog).  Finally, for a film that remains very objective in presenting most events, viewers will be surprised by a very negative portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi and India's first Prime Minister Nehru.  This angle of the film stuck out like a sore thumb to say the least.For all its faults however, Legend of Bhagat Singh has plenty of strengths to make it a superb film.  It tells a great story with style and conviction. It has wonderful performances including one of finest performances ever in Indian cinema by Devgan.  It has great action, moving drama, soothing music, and is (overall) a thoroughly rewarding and entertaining experience.  It comes highly recommended by me.",1,"[legend, bhagat, singh, one, indian, cinema, ambitious, project, date, three, year, painstaking, research, set, construction, veteran, film, maker, raj, kumar, santoshi, actor, ajay, devgan, shot, film, short, stretch, six, month, film, release, early, due, competition, film, deal, roughly, subject, overall, pretty, solid, film, one, help, shake, feel, could, far, superior, product, work, short, film, tell, entire, life, story, indian, freedom, fighter, martyr, bhagat, singh, nut, grow, disillusion, gandhi, passive, movement, lead, independent, violent, struggle, india, recreate, magnificently, film, british, atrocity, commit, portrayed, aplomb, director, one, truly, get, sense, frustrate, condition, could, drive, youngster, violence, revolt, film, strength, hard, hit, portrayal, ...]","[the legend, of, bhagat singh, is, of, indian cinema, most ambitious projects, to, date, after, three years, of, painstaking research, set, construction, veteran film maker raj kumar santoshi and actor, ajay devgan, shot, the film, in, a short stretch, of, six months, the film, released, early due, to, competition, from, other films, dealing, with, roughly, the same subject, overall it, is, a pretty solid film, one, cannot help, shake the feeling, that, it, could have been, a far superior product, if, it, had been worked, on for, a short, while, longer.the film, tells, the entire life story, of, indian freedom fighter and martyr bhagat singh, in, a nut she, will, grew disillusioned, with, gandhi, passive movement, lead, an independent violent struggle, against, the british.colonial india, is recreated, magnificently, in, the film, the british atrocities, committed are portrayed, with, aplomb, by, the director, one, can truly get, a sense, of, how, such frustrating conditions, could drive, youngsters, to, violence, revolt, some of, the film, strengths, are, its hard hitting portrayal, of, british atrocities, its court scenes and its action, scenes.the film, biggest highlight, is, its lead performer, indian actor ajay devgan, ...]",-0.20187860642307784,0.0043002637984387755,1,1,1

Ed Wood would be proud.The Legend of Hercules. This caustic comedy doesn't start at the minute 0 of the movie. The movie in itself is just the tip of the iceberg, to fully understand all the implications and subtlety of this story you have to be familiar with the background. This is NOT an easy movie. Just like Citizen Kane it's a movie you need to DESERVE, as it will not give itself to you too easily.It all starts in a rocking chair next to a swimming-pool. Summer is shining, life is good, whiskey's on the rocks. Some old guy with sun glasses is on the phone, talking while playing Candy Crush.""I'm telling you, people want a gladiator movie. Just like Gladiator, something like that! (Sweet.) Just freaking do something like the series Spartacus, or Rome, I don't (Tasty!) give a damn. I want the script in one week. (Sugar crush.)""One week later 10 screenwriters come up with 10 different scripts. For a movie 10 times better, the guy in the rocking chair decides the movie will be a blend of the 10 scripts.He puts 70 million dollars on the table.The movie is now shot and it's kind of very bad, just how it was supposed to be. It doesn't matter anyway because people just have to go to the cinema once, it's alright if they don't like it and don't come a second time! HA!Worried, some guy calls the money-guy in the rocking chair.""-Hey, I've been thinking, we should use a famous name from the mythology in the title! It will bring more people!-Asklepios?-Eeeehhh, well to be honest I was thinking Hercules...-Oh, alright then.""And so The Legend Of Hercules was born. This movie is not a story, it's money invested and hope for a return. If you make a bad movie but you hit some landmarks: Hercules, mythology, gladiators, somewhat-famous actors, then you'll probably make money.You have to understand the true, deep nature of this movie. The Legend of Hercules is a cry for help, a poetry, a game-changer. The actual purpose of this movie is to impact the global industry, to make producers realize that, no, bad movies actually DON'T WORK, and they are not easy money.A simple, honest, gladiator movie with no fake big name like Hercules, with no fake romance, with just a guy fighting and living in the roman empire would have made more money. It is time to leave the path of using the same recipe over and over again.

The Marine (2006) - IMDb, Thank you Kelly Carlson,FatandUgly16,December/2009,5/10,"I saw this movie on TV and it left me in a state of confusion. I simply could not understand why the people making this movie, made so many misstakes. And what was up with those opening scenes? I got Rambo flashbacks during that. I consider myself to be within the target audience, boys who like action movies with guns, babes, car chases, fights and so on. The problem with this movie IMO is that it underestimates its audience. Just because we like action movies, does not mean we like movies with just action scenes. Nor does it mean that you do not have to make any sense.10 years ago i would have thought that this movie was tha bombe. I would have thought that it was cool. However this is not 1999, it's 2009 (yes, i know the movie is from 2006). After all the things that have happened in the last couple of years, you simply can not show such unbelievable stuff as getting shot at a 120 times from 3-10 meters away during a car chase and not get hit once (outside the Matrix of course).This movie made me doubt myself. Have i learned so much about combat tactics, guns and ammo, warfare, law enforcement, crime and human frailty (from watching Discovery Channel and National Geographic) that i am simply incapable of enjoying a simple action movie? After thinking a lot about that i concluded that the answer is yes. Yes, i know to much to enjoy a simple action movie. And The Marine is about as simple as it gets. A bit more work on the script to make it more logical and coherent and this movie would have scored at least 1 more point (probably 2). I know the marines are tough guys, but i also know marines are not dumb. Stubborn yes, but not dumb. The marine in The Marine is tough and dumb.The Marine is fun to watch, but only when you have nothing else to do. If you need to kill some time, then The Marine will kill it.

The Matrix (1999) - IMDb, Welcome to the Real World.,notoriousCASK11,April/2018,10/10,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",1,"[without, doubt, one, best, influential, movie, time, matrix, define, science, fiction, film, big, leap, genre, take, since, stanley, kubrick, space, odyssey, ridley, scott, blade, runner, matrix, motion, picture, raise, bar, film, come, also, redefine, action, genre, thrill, action, sequence, revolutionary, visual, film, tell, story, thomas, anderson, computer, hacker, world, hack, go, alias, neo, contact, mysterious, outlaw, morpheus, always, question, reality, awaken, truth, world, living, simulated, reality, call, matrix, nothing, slave, dystopian, world, create, control, power, direction, script, wachowskis, fantastic, drew, idea, inspiration, every, great, cyberpunk, movie, anime, film, combine, stun, action, put, one, picture, enough, style, substance, subtext, everyone, end, ...]","[without, a doubt, of, best and, most influential movies, of, all time, the matrix, is, the defining science fiction film, of, 's, biggest, leap, the genre, has taken, since, stanley kubrick, a space odyssey, ridley scott, blade runner, the matrix, is, a ground-breaking motion picture, that, not only raised, the bar, for, all the science-fiction films, to, come, after, it, also redefined, the action genre, with, its thrilling action sequences, revolutionary visual effects.the film, tells, the story, of, thomas, anderson, a computer hacker, that in, the world, of, hacking, goes, by, the alias, of, neo, when, he, is contacted, by, the mysterious outlaw, morpheus, having always questioned, his reality, he, is awakened, to, the truth, that, the world he, is been living, is, simulated, reality, called, the matrix, that, he, is nothing, more, than, a slave, in, this dystopian world, created, controlled, by, powered, machines.the direction, script, by, the wachowskis, is, fantastic, as, they, drew, ideas and inspirations, from, every other great sci-fi, cyberpunk movie, anime, before, ...]",-0.0746678331173556,-0.021359061920026994,1,1,1

The Musketeer (2001) - IMDb, Has its highs and lows,bulldawg81107,April/2006,5/10,"This is a movie that really doesn't know what it is. For one thing, it seems to try and hang on to some parts of the story by Dumas, and yet it also is an entirely different story. Seemingly, the only real similarities are the names of the characters. This movie would be much more effective if it was entirely its own story, and not using the names of the famous characters. The reason? This movie totally dashes the names of those characters.The most unsettling part for me was the fact that the Three Musketeers are nothing like themselves. Porthos is not the least bit arrogant or over-the-top. Aramis isn't religious at all. And Athos does not even remotely resemble the character in the book. Sadly, Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell, but only because he doesn't do any acting at all, which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor, but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said, if you just view it as a movie, and try to block the actual story out of your mind, it can be entertaining. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. Perhaps this movie could have been really good if it was about the story of a musketeer NOT named d'Artagnan, and his unique adventure. But since it tries to be an interpretation of Dumas, it falls miserably short. As a movie, it is so-so, but as far as an interpretation of the famous story, it is absolutely terrible.",0,"[movie, really, know, one, thing, seems, try, hang, part, story, duma, yet, also, entirely, different, story, seemingly, real, similarity, name, character, movie, would, much, effective, entirely, story, use, name, famous, character, reason, movie, totally, dash, name, unsettle, part, fact, three, musketeer, nothing, like, porthos, least, bit, arrogant, aramis, religious, athos, even, remotely, resemble, character, book, sadly, justin, chamber, make, better, chris, donnell, act, better, profuse, overact, donnell, stephen, rea, good, actor, character, remotely, menace, richelieu, say, view, movie, try, block, actual, story, mind, entertain, fight, scene, well, do, pace, keep, viewer, interested, perhaps, movie, could, really, good, story, musketeer, name, ...]","[is, a movie, really does not know, it, is, for, one thing, it, seems, to, try, hang, on to, some parts, of, the story, by, dumas, yet, it, also is, an entirely different story, seemingly, the only real similarities, are, the names, of, the characters, this movie, would be, much more effective, if, it, was, entirely, its, own story, not using, the names, of, the famous characters, the reason, this movie, totally, dashes, the names, of, those characters.the most unsettling part, for, me, was, the fact, that, the three musketeers, are, nothing, like, themselves, porthos, is, not, the least bit, arrogant or over-the-top, aramis, is, not religious, at, athos, does not even remotely resemble, the character, in, the book, sadly, justin chambers, makes, a better d'artagnan, than, chris, o, donnell, only, because, he, does not do, any acting, at, is, better, than, the profuse overacting, of o, donnell, stephen rea is, a good actor, his character, is, not remotely as menacing, as, richelieu, should be.with, ...]",0.07181409187081242,-0.05068505151909376,0,0,0

The Patriot (1998) - IMDb, Not too bad. Seagal is OK here.,the_oak15,March/2005,6/10,"I think this movie is given a bad wrap because it does not have non-stop bone crunching action and because the villains are stereotyped and the plot lines are predictable and ridiculous. Anyways, Seagal is Dr Wesley McClaren, one of the best immunologists in the USA. But he works as more of a nature medicine practitioner in a small mid-western town. His best friend, Frank, is a cowboy style guy played by L Q James. McClaren also has a daughter and a father who is full blooded Indian and lives in an isolate cabin in the mountains. The arch villain here is the neo nazi white trash survivalist, Floyd Chisolm, played by Gailord Sartain. Chisolm is strangely able to get a hand on a super potent biological weapon, and assuming that the anti dote they have will keep them safe, he unleashes this stuff on his own townspeople. Immediately the army is alerted and seal off the place. So Seagal retreats to a super secret laboratory in the mountains (sick!)where he battles to find an anti dote. Not surprisingly the anti dote turns out to be a herb flower that indians has used for centuries. Not much action yet, and not much you will get until Chisolm gets desperate and sends his ""soldiers"" to kidnap Seagal and his daughter. Supposedly McClarens daughter is immune because she has native blood. Frank is killed in this process, leaving Seagal no choice but to put Chisolm out of his misery. This is done in a pretty interesting scene where Chisolm invites the kidnapped Seagal for a glass of Bordeaux wine. Seagal responds by talking calmly about what a piece of trash Chisolm is before breaking his wine class with his thumb and index finger and forcing the broken glass into the man's skull. Priceless! To end it off on a high note the army does not go house to house delivering anti dote in capsules or syringes, no, they sprinkle the flowers out from helicopters hovering the town. The director is Dean Semler, the man behind so diverse films as Bruce Almighty, Dead Calm, Young Guns and Cocktail. If it was not for Seagal and the director this would be a piece of trash too, but strangely, I liked it.",1,"[think, movie, give, bad, wrap, bone, crunch, action, villain, stereotype, plot, line, predictable, ridiculous, anyways, seagal, dr, wesley, mcclaren, one, best, immunologist, usa, work, nature, medicine, practitioner, small, town, best, friend, frank, cowboy, style, guy, played, l, q, james, mcclaren, also, daughter, father, full, blood, indian, life, isolate, cabin, mountain, arch, villain, neo, nazi, white, trash, survivalist, floyd, chisolm, played, gailord, sartain, chisolm, strangely, able, get, hand, super, potent, biological, weapon, assume, anti, dote, keep, safe, unleashes, stuff, townspeople, immediately, army, alert, seal, place, seagal, retreat, super, secret, laboratory, mountain, sick, battle, find, anti, dote, surprisingly, anti, dote, turn, herb, ...]","[i, think, this movie, is given, a bad wrap, because, it, does not have, non-stop bone, crunching, action, because, the villains, are, stereotyped, the plot lines, are, predictable and ridiculous, seagal, is dr, wesley, mcclaren, of, the best immunologists, in, the usa, he, works, as, more, of, a nature medicine practitioner, in, a small mid-western town, his best friend, frank, is, a cowboy style guy, played, by, l q james, mcclaren also has, a daughter, a father, is full blooded, indian and lives, in, an isolate cabin, in, the mountains, the arch villain, here is, the neo nazi, white trash survivalist, floyd chisolm, played, by, gailord sartain, chisolm, is, strangely able, to, get, a hand, on, a super potent biological weapon, assuming, that, the anti dote they, have will keep, them, safe, he, unleashes, this stuff, on, his own townspeople, immediately, the army, is alerted, seal, off, the place, so seagal retreats, to, a super secret laboratory, in, the mountains, sick!)where, he, battles, to, find, an anti dote, not surprisingly, the anti dote, turns out, to, be, a herb flower, ...]",-0.06934871809521352,-0.154393713119896,1,0,0

OK there were flaws in there also(mainly the interior set pieces which look like sound stages), but they should be overlooked, as its not a serious film and is not pretending to be anything other than it is.

The Prince (2014) - IMDb, Unoriginal and unexciting cash grab. Blegh.,paul-szkibik23,August/2014,4/10,"""The Prince"" is entirely unoriginal as it doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. It's generic and formulaic. Everything in this movie you've seen in other movies that came before it, only those movies did it better and they did it first. Uninspired would be the word. No creativity to be found anywhere.Characters: bland. Action: bland. Story: bland. Cinematography: bland.The setup is (too) similar to ""Taken"" where an ""aged father formerly known as Prince"" who happened to be a big deal in the local crime scene in whatever city two decades ago goes looking for his missing daughter killing a bunch of bad guys along the way.The movie tries and fails to establish the main character as this legendary criminal who kicked butt long ago and who now has come back to his old turf in order to save his daughter. How do we know he is this legendary tough guy? Mostly because people in the movie claim that he is (please: show, don't tell), but Jason Patric just can't pull it off as the lead, even if he might be an otherwise competent actor.I think this is mostly the result of poorly written dialog & scenes that just fail to sell us on his violent past. He kinda just seems like a nice guy. Maybe if the movie hadn't tried so hard to be ""Taken"" in the first place and instead made the main character appear more vulnerable & relatable, then discrepancy between what we are promised and what we actually get to see wouldn't be so glaring.Speaking of promises: Despite what the movie poster might imply, neither Bruce Willis nor John Cusack get much screen time, though it's not like their characters are interesting in any way. More screen time with them wouldn't have saved the movie. Willis doesn't give a damn because ""yay money"" and Cussack apparently lost a bet or something, because why else would he want to be part of this movie.I don't mind unoriginal movies, if at least they are well executed in a ""guilty pleasure"" kind of way. A good example of this would be the semi-recent sci-fi action flick ""Lock-Up"", a movie which scratches certain itches and succeeds to be entertaining, even if it has no Oscar worthy performances or a mind-blowing story. ""The Prince"" doesn't provide any guilty pleasure. It provides a reason to call customer service and demand your money back or at least a free rental of ""Lock-Up"".Some may say ""Well it's a genre movie. It doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Take it for what it is: An action movie!"" I am. The movie doesn't succeed. I have watched my fair share of Jet Li/Jason Statham/Vin Diesel etc. movies and suffered through mediocre acting and story telling and in turn got rewarded with at least a couple of interestingly choreographed fight scenes or otherwise neat visuals or interesting set pieces. Not so here. It's just some guy punching or shooting bad guys at boring locations. No interesting fight choreography, camera work, tension... nothing. Most of the action involves our main guy being shot at by incompetent stormtroopers... I mean bad guys, quickly taking cover, then eventually shooting the bad guys because they suck at taking cover -> Level complete.It's not that the people involved in this movie were entirely incompetent, the actors are doing an okay job, the lighting is fine, the camera is, well... capturing what needs to be captured, the story is at least not a confusing mess, the character motivations are mostly clear etc., but ultimately nothing in this movie stands out as original or particularly well done. There is not a single ""Hey, that was cool/interesting/impressive."" moment.""The Prince"" will leave you entirely unsatisfied as you won't care about any of the characters or the twist-free conclusion nor will you get a rush out of any of the action scenes. This movie is not worth your time and especially not worth your money. It's an incredibly lazy straight-to-rental cash-in, using Willis and Cusack to lure people into watching it.

The Pyramid (2014) - IMDb, Not a masterpiece but worth watching despite its bad critics,timelesswind26,May/2015,6/10,"I watched this movie despite its bad reviews because I liked the fact that it is a horror movie in a pyramid and I also quite like movies that have to do with Egyptian history. So after having watched it, I have to say that the one and a half hour I spend doing that was worth it. The pyramid might not be a masterpiece but it is definitely a horror movie worth watching.Firstly, I have to say that the settings were well made as well as the monsters. The actors did a good job too. I can't say that they were amazing but their acting seemed quite natural and they were well directed. Another fact I liked about this movie is that it was decently scary(enough to scare the average watcher) and intense. I quite enjoyed most killing scenes too. In that aspect I think it was better than most horror movies I've seen lately . It could have been more intense though.Coming to the bad points now, as you can probably can guess already the plot is not something new or groundbreaking. You won't see something entirely new here. The only thing that's somewhat ""new"" is that the killings happen in a pyramid. In addition, the movie is not evenly good for its entirety. It starts well, shows promise and is pretty good for a big part but the last part of the movie ruins that feeling. Some scenes of the last part of the movie are not that well-though. Add to that the fact that they probably overdid it a bit with the selection of the ""monster"" and you can understand why it has bad critics. They involved Egyptian mythology a bit too much I guess but I won't spoil further. To sum it up, The pyramid is a horror movie worth watching despite its flaws. They did a good job for a low budget movie like this and an average horror movie fan will surely have a nice time watching it.",1,"[watch, movie, despite, bad, review, like, fact, horror, movie, pyramid, also, quite, like, movie, egyptian, history, watch, say, one, half, hour, spend, worth, pyramid, might, masterpiece, definitely, horror, movie, worth, say, setting, well, make, well, monster, actor, good, job, say, amaze, act, seem, quite, natural, well, direct, another, fact, like, movie, decently, scary, enough, scare, average, watcher, intense, quite, enjoy, kill, scene, aspect, think, better, horror, movie, see, lately, could, intense, bad, point, probably, guess, already, plot, something, new, groundbreaking, see, something, entirely, new, thing, somewhat, new, killing, happen, pyramid, addition, movie, evenly, good, entirety, start, well, show, promise, pretty, ...]","[i, watched, this movie, despite, its bad reviews, because, i, liked, the fact, that, it, is, a horror movie, in, a pyramid, i, also quite, like, movies, have, to, do, with, egyptian history, so, after, having watched, it, i, have, to, say, that, the one and a half hour i spend, doing, was, worth it, the pyramid, might not be, a masterpiece, it, is, definitely, a horror movie, worth, watching.firstly, i, have, to, say, that, the settings, were well made, as well, as, the monsters, the actors, did, a good job, too, i, cannot say, that, they, were, amazing, their acting, seemed, quite natural, they, were well directed, another fact i, liked, about, this movie, is, that, it, was, decently scary(enough, to, scare, the average watcher, intense, i, quite enjoyed most killing, scenes, too, in that, aspect i, think, it, was, better, than, most, horror movies, i have seen, lately, it, ...]",0.23056741080875198,0.0909119341679128,0,2,2
The Pyramid (2014) - IMDb," Uninspired, uneven, uninteresting, and un-scary.",lnvicta3,November/2015,3/10,"This is not a very good movie. The premise may sound promising. The archaeological angle on horror is one that's always interested me, and The Pyramid throws some Greek Mythology in the mix for good measure. Well, the most mythological thing you'll experience during this movie is wishing Hades would drag you into the underworld so you'd never have to remember this atrocity. It's so bad.Visually it reminded me of Alien vs Predator and As Above, So Below, so it's not very original. Atmospherically it reminded me of The Descent, which dealt with claustrophobia infinitely better than this. It's your standard ""team trapped underground"" story where they get picked off one by one. Problem is, every character is one-dimensional so their deaths leave absolutely no impact. The characters themselves are irrational and annoying. ""Hey, we just heard harrowing screams from our friend back there, let's split up!"" Great plan. Oh, and the villains in this movie are one of a kind: Pussy cats. Yeah. Killer cats. And don't worry, the big bad wolf shows up too but I'd rather not say anymore because it's truly a catastrophe best seen for yourself. This is just a dumb movie. I don't know how else to say it. The characters are dumb, the mythos is dumb, the deaths are dumb. There is one jump scare that kind of works but other than that it's horribly directed (going back and forth between found-footage and regular filming was a horrific idea), generic trapped underground story with a third act so ludicrous it's almost worth watching for the laughs.

The Raid 2 (2014) - IMDb," The most highly anticipated film of my life, and it actually met those expectations",ebossert28,March/2014,10/10,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) (Indonesian Action).Viewed on March 28th at the Regal E-Walk cinema in the heart of New York City.After surviving the apartment building raid, Iko Uwais goes undercover to take down an Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese yakuza clan in Jakarta. Things get out of control and everything goes to hell. That's the plot in a nutshell.The fighting is the main draw of this film. Martial arts films are frequently under-appreciated because critics tend to downplay the artistry of orchestrating a fight sequence. In some ways it's like staging a complex dance with extremely difficult performances by physical talents who have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. In many cases it can be even more challenging than executing a good dramatic moment. With that said, ""The Raid 2"" is an exquisite ballet of death with an incredible variety of expertly crafted action sequences that have a grounded, realistic feel to them. It's hard to describe, but despite the insane action there's very little outrageousness present. The choreography here is some of the best ever put on film.There is no question that Uwais is currently the premiere martial arts star, and there is certainly no question that Gareth Evans is the greatest action director on the planet. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind-blowing camera-work. This guy never directed a car chase sequence in his life, and yet his very first attempt is impressive. I did notice a bit more shaky cam in this film when compared to its predecessor, but one can see everything so it's not a problem. Evans is also a pro to create a crescendo of action where every fight seems to outdo the one before it. This generates an absolutely thrilling final hour that will go down in history.The gory violence of ""The Raid 2"" is a big ""screw you"" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge – *cough* ""The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire"" (2013) *cough*. The gore in ""The Raid 2"" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few ""frames"" due to the MPAA review, but I have no idea which frames those were because the now infamous shotgun kill is present in its full, unadulterated glory.The $4.5 million budget is an even bigger ""screw you"" to mega budget Hollywood blockbusters. ""The Raid 2"" has more thrilling action than every $100+ million superhero movie I've ever seen . . . at less than 4.5% of the cost. It's almost unbelievable what these guys can do with a limited budget.Given the exceptional quality of the action, the 148-minute runtime puts some pressure on the story to maintain its momentum between the violence. The first ""Raid"" received much criticism that asserted a generic story and undeveloped characters, but I felt that it nevertheless established a ""feel"" for the characters without the need for long-winded exposition. That ""feel"" can add quite a bit to an action film. ""The Raid 2"" spends more time setting up its premise, which results in some genuine plot and character development. It attempts to do this by taking a generic gangster template and infusing it with a sprawling crime saga that implements many characters. This is essentially a ""chess board"" setup where numerous pieces are first put into place, allowing for many possible confrontations. The viewer is therefore able to relish the moment when a particular piece attacks and takes down another, revealing the actual outcome amidst the countless possibilities. I really liked some of the supporting characters in this, and actually felt a bit sad when they died (even some of the villains!). I am a bit disappointed that both ""Hammer Girl"" and Baseball Bat Man"" are only given a few scenes, but they are certainly memorable. I really liked that brief moment where Hammer Girl picked up her hammers on the bar shelf. It was slightly child-like and innocent, like she was going out to play with friends. This brief, split-second moment can communicate a lot about her character. I suppose it helps to already be a fan of the actors and actresses here, since there are a number of familiar faces from both Indonesian and Japanese film industries. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. The Japanese actors have their little moments, but they could have been given more to do in this. Maybe ""The Raid 3"" will give them more time in the spotlight.Overall, ""The Raid 2"" is a very satisfying action film that justifies its hype after just one viewing. It's simply spectacular.",1,"[note, check, asian, movie, enthusiast, youtube, review, ton, asian, raid, berandal, indonesian, action, march, regal, cinema, heart, new, york, survive, apartment, building, raid, iko, uwais, go, undercover, take, indonesian, crime, syndicate, feud, invasive, japanese, yakuza, clan, jakarta, thing, get, control, everything, go, hell, plot, fight, main, draw, film, martial, art, film, frequently, critic, tend, downplay, artistry, orchestrate, fight, sequence, way, like, stag, complex, dance, extremely, difficult, performance, physical, talent, spent, entire, life, perfect, craft, many, case, even, challenge, execute, good, dramatic, moment, say, raid, exquisite, ballet, death, incredible, variety, expertly, craft, action, sequence, ground, realistic, feel, hard, describe, despite, insane, ...]","[note, check me, out, as, asian movie enthusiast, on, youtube, where, i review tons, of, asian movies.the raid, berandal, indonesian, action).viewed, on, march, at, the regal e-walk cinema, in, the heart, of, new york city.after surviving, the apartment building raid, iko uwais, goes, undercover, to, take, an indonesian crime syndicate, is feuding, with, an invasive japanese yakuza clan, in, jakarta, things, get, out of, control and everything, goes, to, hell, is, the plot, in, a nutshell.the fighting, is, the main draw, of, this film, martial arts films, are, frequently under-appreciated, because, critics, tend, to, downplay, the artistry, of, orchestrating, a fight sequence, in, some ways it, is, like, staging, a complex dance, with, extremely difficult performances, by, physical talents, have spent, their entire lives, perfecting, their craft, in, many cases it, can be, even more, challenging, than, executing, a good dramatic moment, with, said, the raid, is, an exquisite ballet, of, death, with, an incredible variety, of, expertly crafted, action sequences, have, grounded, realistic feel, to, them, ...]",-0.06711994029417713,0.020500258082473535,1,1,1

The Revenant (2015) - IMDb," Great photography, not so great film",mptaylor-5056416,January/2016,3/10,"You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant. And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. Iñárritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen.Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?). Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make.There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really? We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clichéd way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times. The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much. Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but Iñárritu is clearly not David Lean.If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow, ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in, watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining.",0,"[almost, immediately, plunge, action, similar, way, opening, private, ryan, native, american, attack, group, fur, trapper, dicaprio, even, momentarily, deaf, thing, tom, hank, lot, bow, arrow, gore, excellent, photography, really, immersive, great, opening, scene, dicaprio, maul, grizzly, bear, really, believable, excite, front, personal, almost, smell, bear, stink, breath, brilliant, well, much, really, photography, scenery, large, excellent, get, feel, better, use, could, make, iñárritu, often, seem, chop, scene, around, particular, reason, although, get, occasional, sense, vast, wilderness, come, well, big, scarce, go, tom, hardy, try, put, texan, accent, succeeds, sound, sock, mouth, specialise, inaudible, remember, mumble, bane, dark, knight, rise, storyline, know, ...]","[you, are almost immediately plunged, into, the action, in, a similar way, to, the opening, of, saving, private ryan, with, a native american attack, on, a group, of, fur trappers, dicaprio, even does, that, momentarily deaf thing, that, tom hanks, does, lots, of, bows and arrows, gore, excellent photography, is, really immersive, great opening, scene.there, is, the scene, where, dicaprio, is mauled, by, a grizzly bear, again, really believable, exciting, up, front, personal, you, can, almost, smell, bear, stinking, breath, brilliant, then, is, well, not much, really, photography and scenery, are, by, large excellent, you, do get, the feeling, that, better use, could have been made, of, them, iñárritu, often seems, to, chop, scenes, around for, no particular reason, although, you, do get, the occasional sense, of, the vast wilderness, comes, over, well, on, the big screen.dialogue, is, scarce, most, of, it, goes, to, tom, hardy, tries, to, ...]",-0.06156683946176577,2.3070913403631828e-05,1,1,1
The Terminator (1984) - IMDb, The best of the best in its genre...,MovieAddict20165,June/2003,10/10,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.",1,"[rarely, film, frighten, audience, terminator, release, extremely, actioner, broke, box, office, record, give, audience, something, fear, year, story, nature, beast, creature, another, world, forth, jaw, terrify, seem, possible, jaw, terrify, terminator, horrific, realization, machine, dawn, everyone, watch, film, time, exceed, technology, long, man, overtaken, thing, create, particularly, scary, film, like, terminator, terminator, arnold, play, cyborg, cyberdyne, system, model, whatever, mean, sent, back, time, assassinate, future, world, leader, john, connor, battle, machine, future, lead, uprise, connor, kill, one, oppose, machine, future, triumph, would, pretty, bad, future, john, connor, sent, protector, back, time, help, save, mother, kyle, reese, michael, biehn, tell, sarah, ...]","[rarely has, a film, so frightened, an audience, as, the terminator, after, its release, in, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner, broke, box office records, gave, audiences, something, more, to, fear, through, the years, have been, stories, of, nature, beasts, of, creatures, from, another world, so, on, so forth, jaws, was, terrifying, because, it, seemed, so possible, if, jaws, is, terrifying, the terminator, is, horrific, the realization, of, this hit-man machine, dawned, on, everyone, watching, the film, in, a time, of, exceeding, technology, how, long, will, it, be, before, man, is overtaken, by, the very things he, created, is, is, particularly scary, about, a film, like, the terminator, in, the terminator, arnold, plays, a cyborg, cyberdyne system model, a t800, means, he, has been sent, back, in, time, to, assassinate, the soon-to-be-mother, of, the future world leader, john connor, battles, the machines, in, the future, ...]",-0.11480031925408027,0.07618089702904468,1,1,3
The Wild Bunch (1969) - IMDb," ""Let's go.""",TOMASBBloodhound16,March/2006,10/10,"There comes a point at which every man reaches the end of the road and is forced to make a decision. Fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory. It goes without saying that the main characters of this film chose the latter. Sam Peckinpah's classic western is the tale of a gang of outlaws who see the world they know slipping away all around them. Scores are getting more dangerous. Technology is making killing too easy. Still they fight on, because they simply wouldn't have it any other way.William Holden plays a man named Pike Bishop. He and his gang of outlaws hit banks, trains, you name it. They stick together no matter how thick things get. After a failed attempt at a bank robbery in which nearly an entire town is gunned down, the gang sets out to steal a shipment of new guns from the US Army and sell them to a Mexican general. But this will not be an easy score. Not only will they have to fend of US soldiers, but the railroad has hired a former member of their gang named Deke Thornton and a bunch of sloppy bounty hunters to stop them. Also, the Mexican general is a dangerous man with hundreds of men at his disposal. Pancho Villa and his army are also in the area. Bullets are going to fly, and fly they do.From the opening shot of children torturing a couple scorpions to death by feeding them to a colony of ants, this film makes its point very thoroughly about violence. In this shot we see efficient killers overwhelmed by an army of a weaker species of animal. The scorpions are a metaphor for Pike and his gang. Outnumbered at every turn, they are still a handful for those who would try to hunt them down.Pike and his men are able to pull off the score and deliver the guns to the general. But they don't go riding off happily into the sunset like the heroes of a traditional western. Their story could never end that way. Knowing that their way of life is coming to an end, and knowing that one of the gang is being tortured by the general, Pike calls the remaining members together. ""Let's go,"" he simply tells them. Each man knows what this means. They grab every gun they own and all the ammunition they can carry. Then they take a nice stroll down the main street of the general's compound to pay him and his army a little visit. The resulting gun battle has to be seen to be believed.Once the shooting stops, there is an odd; sad feeling that settles over the compound. The bounty hunters show up when the vultures do. The sight of his former companions' dead bodies slumped over the backs of horses is too much for Thornton to bear. You know he would have rather been there by their side during the battle, and now he cannot bring himself to claim the reward for their hides. He simply sits down in the dirt as the survivors of the compound quietly file out and an ominous wind begins blowing through the dusty streets. Moments later it's his turn to make a choice. You can't help but feel he made the right one.The Wild Bunch is an incredible film. If ever a film was ahead of it's time, this is it. See it! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",1,"[come, point, every, man, reach, end, road, force, make, decision, fade, away, go, blaze, glory, go, without, say, main, character, film, chose, latter, sam, peckinpah, classic, western, tale, gang, outlaw, see, world, know, slip, away, around, score, get, dangerous, technology, make, kill, easy, still, fight, simply, would, holden, play, man, name, pike, bishop, gang, outlaw, hit, bank, train, name, stick, together, matter, thick, thing, get, fail, attempt, bank, robbery, nearly, entire, town, gun, gang, set, steal, shipment, new, gun, u, army, sell, mexican, general, easy, score, fend, u, soldier, railroad, hire, former, member, gang, name, deke, thornton, bunch, sloppy, bounty, ...]","[comes, a point, at, which every man, reaches, the end, of, the road, is forced, to, make, a decision, fade, away, go, out in, a blaze, of, glory, it, goes, without, saying, that, the main characters, of, this film, chose, the latter, sam peckinpah, classic western, is, the tale, of, a gang, of, outlaws, see, the world they, know slipping, away, all around them, scores, are getting, more dangerous, technology, is making killing, too easy, still, they, fight, on, because, they, simply would not have, it, other, holden plays, a man, named, pike bishop, he and his gang, of, outlaws, hit, banks, trains, you, name, it, they, stick, together, no matter, how, thick things, get, after, failed, attempt, at, a bank robbery, in, nearly, an entire town, is gunned, down, the gang sets, out, to, steal, a shipment, of, new guns, from, the us, army, sell, them, to, ...]",-0.08754044296796061,-0.06095305071535612,1,0,1

He sets out to create the most violent Western to date, and he succeeds. The body count here is higher than in some wars. Every death is captured in slow-motion and augmented with jets of blood. Perhaps these novel visuals were thrilling and shocking to moviegoers in the late 1960s, but decades later desensitization has long since set in. The violence in ""The Wild Bunch"" has not aged well, and there is little else of interest in the film. A thin storyline links one scene of carnage to the next, but the movie doesn't know what to do with its characters between the action.

Thugs of Hindostan (2018) - IMDb," Vijay Krishna Achraya completes his hattrick of horrible films with Tashan, Dhoom 3 and now Thugs Of Hindostan",ketgup838,November/2018,5/10,"2018 was a fantastic year for Bollywood thanks to movies like Padman, Padmaavat, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, Stree, Parmanu, Raid, Tumbbad, AndhDhun , Badhaai Ho etc. Unfortunate part is that we do have movies like Race 3, Namastey England which are repeated and outdone while the essence of the flavor is dying. Thugs Of Hindostan belongs to the second list which tries hard to entertain you but falls flat on the face.Thugs Of Hindostan tells the story of Khudabaksh (Amitabh Bachchan ), who fights against British empire for a free independent India. He is supported by his adopted daughter, Zafira (Fatima Sana Shaikh). Being opposed by strong army of Khudabaksh, the British Empire hires Firangi (Aamir Khan), to fight for them and defeat Khudabaksh.From the director of terrible films like Tashan and Dhoom 3, Vijay Krishna Achrya gives you yet another disappointing film. So much was expected from Thugs Of Hindostan but the lousy direction , insensible screenplay and terrible editing gives you a headache which you never asked especially from a star like Aamir Khan. The good news is that Thugs Of Hindostan is better than craps like Dhoom 3 and Tashan as it has visually appealing CGI with some amazing action sequences. I loved the background score which gels well with the mood of the film. The entry scene of Amitabh Bachchan is classy while Aamir Khan does well in the first half. However, his frequent change of party, though was nice to some extent , was leading to boredom eventually. I wanted to ask him after working hard so much for Dangal in 2016, what made him choose this script which required to prepare for 2 years.The plot is weak while the length of the film spoils the entire mood of the film. Music is another complete letdown. Art direction and cinematography is mind blowing. Amitabh Bachchan does well but does not get much scope to show his skills. Aamir Khan does raise few laughs but much was expected from the actor of his stature. Fatima Sana Shaikh does well in her role as Zafira. Katrina Kaif as usual is used for glamour purpose and is wasted.Overall, Thugs Of Hindostan is loud, lousy and unconvincing.

Thunderbirds (2004) - IMDb, Makes you want to take up Bird shooting,cosmic_quest2,April/2006,3/10,"'Thunderbirds' was an immensely popular Sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday. So, one would deduce the chance to produce a live-action feature film with a million pound Hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'Spider-Man' and 'The X-Men'. But a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section.Instead of a film focusing on the five Tracey sons, their father and trusty geek Brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen-year-old Alan Tracey, fourteen-year-old Tin-tin and ten-year-old brain-box Fermat, son of Brains (yes, Brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish). As one can tell from a run-through of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake 'Thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age-range as those involved in the much superior revival of 'Spider-Man' did. The plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre-teens. The scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'Spy Kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.Although Sophia Myles and Ron Cook were excellent as Miss Penelope and Parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt. Bill Paxton's Jeff Tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four Tracey boys while Anthony Edwards and Ben Kingsley, as Brains and the Hood respectively, were just embarrassing. The Hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, two-bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.Brady Corbet, who plays Alan Tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for Vanessa Anne Hutchinson as Tin-tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'Girl Power'. Ironically, it is young Soren Fulton's Fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as Fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.'Thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances!

Torque (2004) - IMDb," C'mon, it's a B-movie! Lighten up! (***)",Ronin471,February/2004,7/10,"A lot of people think that I love the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies because I think they're ""so bad, they're good"", when that's actually not true. On the contrary, I think they are pretty smart (especially in the precise way they constantly reference pop culture in clever and heartfelt ways). And yes, they are totally silly and unrealistic and goofy, but what I like about that is that it's completely intentional (which is what most people don't get, and is so obvious to me).""Torque"", on the other hand, is a perfect example of a movie that is TRULY so bad, it's good. Or at least enjoyable in a surreal, lunatic sort of way. This movie seriously doesn't have a brain in its head.In every sense a B-movie, it most resembles those gleefully exploitive, low-budget movies that Roger Corman and Russ Meyer made decades ago, where biker gangs did battle with their switchblade-toting girlfriends at their side. And it's every bit as silly as it sounds, which could be either good news or bad news for you, depending on what kind of filmgoer you are.
Personally, I knew it was crap the whole time, but still had a blast watching it. The story is ridiculous and the dialogue is ludicrous (these characters exist in a world where when a girl says ""Nice bike"", the guy says ""Nice a**"" and she LIKES it). But I cannot fully resist a movie in which two improbably beautiful biker chicks stare each other down on their bikes in a photogenic, deserted alleyway (both of them in front of huge product logos, for extra giggles), one of them yells ""Bring it on, b****!"", the other whips out a switchblade, and then they charge! As a classic B-movie enthusiast, I offer no apologies for having fun watching a scene like that.
It's really not all bad, either. Martin Henderson and Monet Mazur have some genuinely nice and tender scenes together, and the great, color-conscious cinematography makes everything look so shiny you could eat off the screen. Jamie Pressly is an absolute hoot as the evil biker chick, and Adam Scott scores some laughs as a conceited F.B.I. agent.Also, several of the action scenes are pretty amazing, once you get over the idea that this movie is obviously not taking place on planet Earth, but rather some video game universe or a 12 year-old's dream.
I wish Ice Cube was off doing the kinds of good movies he used to make (like ""Three Kings"", the original ""Friday"", ""Boyz N The Hood"", ""Higher Learning"", ""Ghosts Of Mars""...), but he contributes some laughs as one of the heavies here. I do wish he had changed his expression at least once, though. You know the one where he grits his teeth and curls his upper lip so that he look like he hates your guts and steam is about to come out of his ears? That's the one that he has throughout the entire movie.
Basically, I'm not gonna fight for this movie or anything, I realize it's of essentially no value. I'll just say that it made it easy for me to shut off my brain and I enjoyed it, and maybe you will too. I give ""Torque"" 3 stars the same way I would give ""Switchblade Sisters"" 3 stars.

Torque (2004) - IMDb, Physically Enduring to Watch,polkaband26,February/2005,1/10,"There are bad movies and then there are painful movies. Then there's Torque which very well may have defined a new term of ""bad"".For those previous comments who argue that this is a B-Movie and that viewers should ""lighten up"" - you need to look up your definitions. A B movie is low budget. This was obviously not low budget. I would have to lighten up to the degree of being an overexposed photograph of the kid from Powder to even watch another minute of this film again.There is something about cult or campy flicks that is difficult to explain. On paper or at face value a campy movie can be bad but there's a sense of ""fun"" in it. You can watch Faster Pussycat Kill Kill and think that they actually had fun filming it AND screening it. You watch Torque and you think that on day 33 of the shoot it must have been painful beyond belief for the crew to answer their alarm clocks.Torque doesn't work in ANY labeling of film. It isn't low budget. It doesn't feel campy. It isn't even funny bad. Unless the real life actors are complete idiots in real life they must have been downright embarrassed by this. It paid their bills though.There is ZIP for any sort of conversation that even mildly could be construed as entertaining. The editing is a total MTV hyperkenetic ADD disaster. The stunts are neither even remotely plausible or interesting. The love interest scenario was as cliché as possible. Ice Cube couldn't act his way out of a styrofoam cup in any movie previously and it still shows.I feel that this movie was literally a physical challenge to watch. Around the midway point I felt like I had just free climbed Devil's Tower. Perhaps I lost a few years of my life from the physical exhaustion this movie delivered to my body.On the upside though - I feel like after having watched this movie I could watch any 9 hour insurance seminar without batting an eye.

Ultraviolet (2006) - IMDb," Hot body, not much else going on",Lithigin3,March/2006,3/10,"Ultraviolet was embarrassingly terrible on so many levels. My husband and I usually really dig the comic book and action movies, so I think that our expectations were reasonable for the genre. The kinds of movies that Ultraviolet tried to channel were X-Men, The Matrix and Underworld. Unfortunately, this movie failed to do so.1) Dialogue was laughably bad. One of Milla's lines was actually ""Because these beautiful moments turn evil when they're over."" What?? This was regarding a romantic pass made at her. Totally incongruous with the setting. 2) Excessive use of CGI is a personal irritant. Additionally, the motorcycle chase scenes were only one step above TRON. I might as well have been watching my 11 year old neighbors play some video game. 3) Zero character development. I didn't care about Violet, the french guy, the scientist guy, the pretty boy, or the evil nose filter guy. I didn't care about their individual goals (mainly because they weren't very clear). I didn't care about characters dying, and I didn't care about the revelation at the end; the only indicator that I had that it was important was her somewhat awed reaction.To be fair, Milla Jovovich has an incredible face and body and is well-suited for fight scenes. If all-CGI, all-the-time is your thing, then you'll be thrilled with the loads of glossed-over fight scenes involving Milla and hordes of green screen baddies.

Instead of showing the least amount of fear over the killing and mayhem going on around her, she's doing her ""I-a-reporter-with-a-scoop"" dialogue.  I was hoping that Romeo or another soldier would take her out.Fourth plot problem, Kiana Tom, Van Damme's butt-kicking sidekick at the beginning of the movie, is left on the sidelines for most of the movie.

Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) - IMDb, So bad it is entertaining,mentalcritic26,August/2005,1/10,"The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy, however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. If you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre.",0,"[mind, boggles, exactly, universal, soldier, merit, sequel, since, real, star, dolph, lundgren, would, able, reprise, role, original, already, scant, reason, indulge, oneself, obvious, tax, bold, attempt, make, fill, gap, professional, wrestler, bill, goldberg, martial, art, expert, michael, jai, white, credit, give, action, sequence, good, sense, excitement, bill, goldberg, look, like, time, life, film, make, fair, stab, fill, requisite, comedic, villain, role, role, kind, involves, repeat, line, time, get, irritate, problem, audience, point, view, neither, gentleman, really, sense, comic, timing, minor, humility, make, lundgren, pleasure, watch, almost, film, therein, lie, problem, go, see, van, damme, film, want, serious, action, go, want, ...]","[the mind boggles, at, exactly, about, universal soldier, merited, a sequel, since, the real star, dolph, lundgren, would not be, able, to, reprise, his role, from, the original, is, already scant reason, to, indulge, oneself, in, this obvious tax write-off, bold attempts, are made, to, fill, the gap, with, professional wrestler bill goldberg, martial arts, expert michael, white, to, their credit, they, give, their action, sequences, a good sense, of, excitement, bill goldberg, looks, like, he, is having, the time, of, his life, on, this film, he, makes, a fair stab, at, filling, the requisite comedic villain role, for, once, his role, is, the kind, involves repeating, same, line, a few times, it, does not get, irritating, the problem, from, the audience, point, of, view, is, that, neither of, these gentlemen, really have, the sense, of, comic timing, minor humility, makes lundgren such, a pleasure, to, watch, in, almost, all of his films, therein lies, the problem, you, do not go, to, see, ...]",-0.15064700405382778,0.08259959978447624,1,1,3

Vaastav: The Reality (1999) - IMDb, Sanjay Dutt's reality show.,Peter_Young3,May/2010,7/10,"The talented Mahesh Manjrekar directs his second feature which centres around the character of a simple guy whose attempts to lead a normal life fail and as a result he becomes a merciless underworld don. Manjrekar's direction is excellent and he successfully depicts the dark tone of the crime world. He offers a grim look at the underworld and not even once does he try to glorify it or show it in a positive light. On the contrary, through the main character he shows how restless those who get involved in it are. The film, though a bit unevenly executed at places, generally remains steadily focused, and the proceedings are raw and serious, without useless attempts at comedy and unnecessary subplots one gets to see so much in Hindi films. Many of the film's scenes are extremely moving.For the demanding role of Raghunath, Manjrekar casts Sanjay Dutt, one of the industry's most respected and loved stars, yet one of its most underrated actors. Dutt is simply exceptional, portraying every shade of his character with sheer conviction. He actually becomes Raghunath and manages to create a real new screen persona with his line delivery, body language and his often frighteningly serene attitude. This is one of his absolute best. Other cast members do a very good job, with Reema Lagoo delivering the most memorable performance of the lot as Raghu's tormented yet loving mother. Sanjay Narvekar is quite effective as his best friend, while Namrata Shirodkar does a fine job as Sonu, a young prostitute with whom he falls in love.Vaastav is not without its flaws. I, for one, found Raghunath's transformation far too quick to be completely believable. The film, though generally gritty, intense and matter-of-fact, gets at times a bit too emotional and consequently the level of its authenticity is thus reduced by a iota. Nonetheless, the film's final scenes are powerful and riveting and the very last scene is fantastic.

His role reminds me of his role in Running Scared as he seems to have a short fuse and quite foul-mouthed. Don't let the trailers of this movie fool you however. You see Paul Walker and car chases and might expect a Fast and the Furious type of flick. However this movie is more of a car adventure/drama than action/car chase movie.

Vehicle 19 (2013) - IMDb, Casey's Movie Mania: VEHICLE 19 (2013),caseymoviemania7,May/2013,5/10,"A low budget indie thriller with an interesting concept, but VEHICLE 19  suffers from sluggish pace and short of adrenaline rush.  The first thing that attracted me to watch this low-budget indie  thriller called VEHICLE 19 is its irresistible concept -- the movie is  shot entirely from inside the car. Now that's what I called a great  novelty. However, South African director Mukunda Michael Dewil fails to  capitalize his own concept. Instead of a fast-paced thriller normally  expected from this kind of movie, VEHICLE 19 sputters as it moves  along.  Somewhere in between, director Mukunda Michael Dewil manages to stage  some claustrophobic moments and worthy action scenes within the  confined space of a car (and limited budget). Paul Walker is fairly  adequate to put on a (mostly) one-man show as a brooding and manic  anti-hero.  It's a shame that Mukunda Michael Dewil's script is lackluster. More  than often, the movie loses its momentum whenever it tries to elaborate  the storyline. The pace is patchy, while the movie's overly-stylized  look is too distracting for its own good.  Overall, VEHICLE 19 only works in certain angles. The rest of them are  as rusty as a beat-up engine.",0,"[low, budget, indie, thriller, interest, concept, vehicle, suffers, sluggish, pace, short, adrenaline, rush, first, thing, attract, watch, indie, thriller, call, vehicle, irresistible, concept, movie, shot, entirely, inside, car, call, great, novelty, however, south, african, director, mukunda, michael, dewil, fails, capitalize, concept, instead, thriller, normally, expect, kind, movie, vehicle, sputter, move, along, somewhere, director, mukunda, michael, dewil, manages, stage, claustrophobic, moment, worthy, action, scene, within, confine, space, car, limited, budget, paul, walker, fairly, adequate, put, mostly, show, brooding, manic, shame, mukunda, michael, dewil, script, lackluster, often, movie, loses, momentum, whenever, try, elaborate, storyline, pace, patchy, movie, look, distract, good, overall, vehicle, ...]","[a low budget indie thriller, with, an interesting concept, vehicle, suffers, from, sluggish pace, short, of, adrenaline rush, the first thing, that, attracted, me, to, watch, this low-budget indie thriller, called, vehicle, is, its irresistible concept, the movie, is shot, entirely, from inside, the car, now, is, i, called, a great novelty, however, south african director mukunda michael dewil, fails, to, capitalize, his own concept, instead, of, a fast-paced thriller, normally expected, from, this kind, of, movie, vehicle, sputters, as, it, moves, along, somewhere, in between, director mukunda michael dewil, manages, to, stage, some claustrophobic moments, worthy action scenes, within, confined, space, of, a car, limited budget, paul walker, is, fairly adequate, to, put, on, mostly, one-man show, as, brooding, manic anti-hero, it, is, a shame, that, mukunda michael dewil, script, is, lackluster, more, than, often, the movie, loses, its momentum, whenever, it, tries, to, elaborate, the storyline, the pace, is, patchy, while, ...]",0.024406964527332632,-0.1348401833441549,0,0,0

This is a Neo Noir movie which happens rarely in Tamil. Story is simple straight forward police and gangster cat and mouse or I could say hide seek game. The wow factor is the screenplay which is well crafted and characterisations are well etched. The perfect pace stands out first kept the audience thrilled and guessing till the end. Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play. Coming to the performances Madhavan as Vikram the protagonist a perfect police maintains his grip and emotes intensive emotions particularly when he feels he was used. Vijay Sethupathy on the other hand essays antagonist Vedha a most wanted leader of local gang pulling it off effortlessly seriously effortlessly like so much of assaultness the way he carries himself stands out unique particularly. Loved the in between short stories he threw. Both Madhavan and VJS with their exposed grey carried on their roles picture perfect. They present raw psychological thriller duo. All the other support characters were picked perfect. Varalakshmi's plays an extended cameo but stands out as well the new face lady who plays the lawyer and wife of Vikram.

Kamal Hassan's biggest-ever film Viswaroopam, which has been delayed for one or the other reason, has seen the light of day in foreign countries but not in Tamil Nadu and some other Southern states as the High Court has stayed the release after several Muslim groups raised objection. After a gap of three years, Kamal Hassan is back with Viswaroopam, which is written, directed and produced by himself. The film was supposed to be directed by Selvaraghavan but as the director walked out of the film due to other commitments, Kamal took the responsibility of directing the film. The film is simultaneously made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. It is made with the budget of Rs 95 crore, which is the second highest budget Tamil film after Rajinikanth's blockbuster Endhiran. What does the multilingual action-thriller has to offer? A reader named Praveen Kumar from New Jersey reviewed the film, as the movie was not released here. Read on for the review... The movie starts in America. Viswanath (Kamal Hassan), who will be seen as Kathak trainer, is surrounded by girls and one among them is Andrea Jeremiah. This makes Dr Nirupama (Pooja Kumar) to doubt on her hubby's character and hires a detective, who gets killed by Al-Qaeda group. The Al-Qaeda is planning to plant a Nuclear Bomb in New York and Kamal Hassan is well-aware of it. How? He has a past where he has a connection with the terrorist group, which is headed by Omar (Rahul Bose). Will the terrorist organisation succeed in their mission? What role does Kamal play? Is he a terrorist or an undercover agent? To know all these, you should watch the film. The story of the film begins on a slow note but it is gripping.

Wild Wild West (1999) - IMDb, Don't the people making these movies LIKE the original shows?,schmigrex13,July/2008,1/10,"I won't add more insults -- others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First, how about getting someone to write/direct that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the West-Gordon relationship was the core. In a sense, West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick, functional crime-fighting machine: West handled the action and romance, and Gordon took care of the thinking, deception, and humor (disguises). This was a well-used TV convention -- think the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad in Star Trek, or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix (not an offensive atrocity like the film-Loveless) and you've got a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.Second, why all the emphasis on showing the principals getting to know each other? I know -- because it eats up 30% of the script, and creates conflict. But the conflict should be between West and the villain. Jim and Artie should just BE. The TV show didn't bother explaining how West met and knew Gordon, any more than Barney Miller, Mission Impossible, or 24 found it necessary to have all the main characters meet and learn to work together. They were a team with a job to do. Audiences understand this concept; having a trumped-up plot about how the heroes meet and overcome their differences is a hackneyed device that only exposes the script weaknesses present. See the film version of Dragnet (a better film, though) for another example of this unfortunate trend.Finally, a comment on the ""race"" issue. Inserting content that justifies Smith-West's skin color is no more necessary than explaining Henry V's skin color when Laurence Fishburne or Andre Braugher play him on stage. Indeed, ignoring Smith's race in a movie like this one would help us all look past such issues. If a blond actor had portrayed West, nobody would have suggested a plot that explains his Norwegian background! He just would have been West, and that would be that. But color-blind casting requires courage, and could conceivably cut into the film's bottom line. So, not in this spineless script.I seldom get mad at movies I don't like. Even The Avengers didn't anger me, though it was possibly even worse than this one. This one ticked me off REAL good. Buy the original series on DVD instead, and see how it's done right.",0,"[add, insult, others, do, well, enough, movie, godawful, point, two, area, seem, staple, bad, movie, remake, beloved, old, tv, show, first, get, someone, actually, like, understood, original, person, would, understand, relationship, core, sense, west, gordon, compliment, make, slick, functional, machine, west, handle, action, romance, gordon, take, care, think, deception, humor, disguise, tv, convention, think, triad, star, trek, great, contrasty, chemistry, bill, cosby, robert, culp, spy, add, lovable, villain, mix, offensive, atrocity, like, get, crazy, action, classic, filmmaker, seemingly, know, care, fundamental, original, show, necessarily, problem, bother, resurrect, premise, first, place, make, smith, different, wild, west, troubleshooter, mission, impossible, franchise, emphasis, ...]","[i, will not add, more insults, others, here have done, that, well enough, this movie, is, godawful, i, will point, two areas, seem, to, be, staples, of, bad movie remakes, of, beloved old tv shows, first, how, about, getting, someone, to, write/direct, that, actually liked, understood, the original, that, person, would understand, that, the west-gordon relationship, was, the core, in, a sense, west and gordon, complimented, other, to, make, a slick, functional crime-fighting machine, west, handled, the action, romance, gordon, took, care, of, the thinking, deception, humor, disguises, was, a well-used tv convention, think, the kirk-spock-mccoy triad, in, star trek, the great contrasty chemistry, between, bill cosby and robert culp, in, i spy, add, a lovable villain, to, the mix, not, an offensive atrocity, like, film-loveless, you, have got, a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action, classic, the filmmakers, here seemingly did not know, care, about, the fundamentals, of, the original show, not, that, is, necessarily, a problem, then why, bother resurrecting, the premise, in, ...]",-0.03968425580312797,0.01934913775986345,1,1,1

Wing Commander (1999) - IMDb, Not as bad as everyone says it is... but not as good either,Oreolove30,June/2002,5/10,"I was intrigued, after hearing many different points of views on this movie, to go see it. So I go to this used tape store, (why rent it for $5 when you can buy it for $2?) and buy it. I just wanted to see which side I agreed with. Most people that stated their opinions, said that this movie was a waste of time. Other people said it was the best movie they've ever seen, but I'm guessing they were fans of the video game or the 1977 version of this movie, both of which I've never seen. To go straight to the point and make it easy for those who don't know whether to see it or not, I'll let you decide for yourself based on my opinion. So to make it simple I'll just say the good and bad stuff about it.Bad Stuff:~Freddie Prinze Jr. sucks at acting. There's no other way to put it. I got very bored watching his one expression and monotone voice.~Right from the beginning, I thought the music was terrible. Music is supposed to drag you in from the beginning and give you a sense of what's coming, (think ""Jaws."") This just made me feel like I was about to see Captain America.~The alien make-up was so extremely ridiculous that they looked like overgrown house pets. Not scary at all. ~I got tired of hearing people state the obvious. ""Hey! I think something's wrong!"" Well, aren't you the sharp one. The exploding bombs and loud ""red alert"" beeping didn't give it away, did it?~The story had it's boring moments. There were parts I didn't follow and soon didn't even care, because I had gotten so lost by then it didn't matter.~*This may or may not be a downside* I wasn't sure if the accents in this movie were taken from the video game or original, but it was way too weird. We had a Scottish guy, a ton of Englishmen, Americans, and some Asians. How did they all get on this one ship?Good Stuff:~Matthew Lillard did a fabulous job. I'm so used to seeing him act like an a**hole, (no offense, think ""Scream."") that I wasn't expecting the serious performance he gave. It blew me away how serious he had to be in some scenes, and he pulled it off beautifully. (Although I gave the movie 5 stars, I would like to give his performance a 10.)~The plotline, although confusing, did have it's certain interesting moments. I don't know which came first, Starship Troopers or this, but I have a feeling one of them is a rip-off of the first. However, it certainly had it's moments that put you in suspense.~The special effect were great. It reminded me a lot of Star Wars.

X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - IMDb, A stunning achievement – a blockbuster movie packed with at least as much heart as spectacle.,shawneofthedead16,May/2014,9/10,"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.",1,"[premise, cast, day, future, past, blast, cinema, bearing, weight, great, expectation, surely, past, future, potential, best, superhero, blockbuster, world, ever, see, well, yes, strictly, objective, day, future, past, occasionally, come, little, earnest, enormous, cast, character, get, somewhat, lose, grind, narrative, gear, work, time, day, future, past, come, pretty, darn, close, nerdvana, smart, rich, film, effectively, mine, source, material, movie, chris, claremont, classic, storyline, comic, book, incredible, cast, emotion, power, forward, bleakest, future, know, lead, perennial, frenemies, professor, charles, xavier, patrick, stewart, erik, ian, mckellen, hunt, mercilessly, horde, intelligent, robot, know, sentinel, little, hope, survival, desperate, decide, send, wolverine, hugh, jackman, ...]","[with, its mind-boggling premise, jaw-dropping cast, x-men, days, of, future, past blasts, into, cinemas, bearing, the weight, of, great expectations, surely, this mash-up, of, x-men past and future, has, potential, to, be, the best superhero, blockbuster, our world, will ever see, well, no.to, be, strictly objective, days, of, future, past, can occasionally come, off as, a little too earnest, its enormous cast, of, characters, getting somewhat lost, in, the grinding, of, its narrative gears, when, it, works, is, most, of, the time, days, of, future past, comes, pretty darn, close, to, nerdvana –, is, a smart, rich film, that, effectively mines its source material, both the movies, chris claremont, classic, 1981 storyline, in, the comic books, its, incredible cast, for, emotion, power, depth.flash, forward, to, bleakest, of, futures, x-men we, have known, –, led, by, perennial frenemies, professor, charles, xavier, patrick stewart, erik lensherr/magneto, ian, mckellen, –, are being hunted, mercilessly, by, a horde, ...]",-0.11032794571868493,-0.03311088856814679,1,1,1
X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - IMDb," Some great highlights, a lot of disappointment.",FisheyFilms22,May/2014,5/10,"*Spoilers*I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. To start with the good points.The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.Now for the not so good points.Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once.

Yoga Hosers (2016) - IMDb, In All Seriousness What Happened to Kevin Smith?,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha9545,December/2016,2/10,"Now when I first saw the trailer to Kevin Smith's (Clerks, Dogma) Yoga Hosers I was a little surprised. Now for those who have not seen the trailer for this film, and are asking yourself ""What the Hell are some Yoga Hosers?"" The trailer focuses on the two Canadian girls from Smith's last film, Tusk. Who work at a convenience store, and encounter Nazi sausages. Seriously. When I saw the trailer, my immediate instinct reaction was ""What the f*ck?"" It wasn't that what the f*ck with anger, it wasn't what the f*ck with confusion, it really was just a simple what the f*ck. Now I love Kevin Smith films. He always seemed like a cool person, he is well spoken, writes scripts with compelling characters and story, and he seems like the kind of guy you could easily talk with. His last film Tusk, in my opinion was his worst film. The films plot was there and it sounded great. What I personally didn't enjoy was the pace of the film and the characters. At least that film had a story wrapped around in it. Most people, including myself love the art form of filmmaking and movies for two main reasons. That being a story the audience can connect to and characters and audience can connect to. In my opinion, Yoga Hosers has very little story, with characters an audience cannot connect to, it isn't that funny, it's annoying, and I personally didn't get it.I do not know if Kevin Smith made this film to mess with critics, the media, and fans. Or is he just this bad of a filmmaker now? Sadly, out there in the world there really is an individual who has a film script. A film script with story, compelling characters, a story that is a breath of fresh air, and a script that is really written with heart. Unfortunately, we may never have a chance to see it, because Kevin Smith had to bring us f*cking Yoga Hosers. Sorry Ah-Boot ThatI don't know where to start with this film. For God's sake, there is even a Marvel cameo of Stan Lee in this! I didn't go into this movie thinking it was terrible. I saw it on Netflix, went in with a clear unbiased mind, and 80 minutes later I'm shocked. The one good part of this movie is Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp. Those two actually to capture the spirit of Clerks in a way. I found them to be a little funny. But the rest of it is just bad acting and really bad Canadian jokes. They run the same joke into the ground over and over and over and over again. I didn't know it was possible to offend and be prejudice towards Canadians. After seeing this movie, well Goddamn it is possible if you're Kevin Smith. We f*cking get it, Canadians say EH (A) ever so often. When they say about, sometimes it sounds like they are saying Ah- boot. At first it is a chuckle. After that, it is just sad; the whole movie is Eh and Ah-boot! That damn title card pops up every ten minutes when they introduce a character is bad! It looks like a want to be Scott Pilgrim and Suicide Squad.The cast is talented, but the story and they way it's written is completely ridiculous. Pucky Charms cereal ever ten minutes in your face, terrible Canadian slang jokes, looks like a 1990s video game in 2016, and this is the director of Clerks, Dogma, and Chasing Amy. There is no way in Hell this movie was made seriously, it is clearly a joke. A joke I personally do not find funny.This film is worse than Tusk. If you enjoyed it, I am more than glad you did. Maybe I just don't get the joke. Kevin Smith's down dude since day one is in this, Mr. Jason Mewes! And even he is in this for two minutes, with the look on his face like yeah I don't need this right now. Really it is a shame, it's a mess, and I will always like and respect Kevin Smith. But recently his work, his legacy, his films have gone so far down the sh*tter I don't think he can cleanly come back up. Sorry Ah-boot that, yeah you should be sorry for this sh*t you call a movie!I believe this ""movie"" earns a2 out of 10.Worst Kevin Smith film.",0,"[first, saw, trailer, kevin, smith, clerk, dogma, yoga, hosers, little, surprised, see, trailer, film, ask, hell, yoga, hosers, trailer, focus, two, canadian, girl, smith, last, film, tusk, work, convenience, store, encounter, nazi, sausage, seriously, saw, trailer, immediate, instinct, reaction, anger, confusion, really, simple, love, kevin, smith, film, always, seem, like, cool, person, well, spoken, writes, script, compelling, character, story, seems, like, kind, guy, could, easily, talk, last, film, tusk, opinion, bad, film, film, plot, sound, great, personally, enjoy, pace, film, character, least, film, story, wrap, around, people, include, love, art, form, filmmaking, movie, two, main, reason, story, audience, connect, character, ...]","[now when, i first, saw, the trailer, to, kevin, smith, clerks, dogma, yoga hosers, i was, little surprised, now, for, have not seen, the trailer, for, this film, are asking, yourself, the hell, are, some yoga hosers, the trailer, focuses, on, the two canadian girls, from, smith, last film, tusk, work, at, a convenience store, encounter nazi sausages, seriously, when, i, saw, the trailer, my immediate instinct reaction, was, the f*ck, it, was, not, that, the f*ck, with, anger, it, was, not, the f*ck, with, confusion, it, really was, just, simple, the f*ck, now i love kevin smith films, he, always seemed, like, a cool person, he, is well spoken, writes, scripts, with, compelling characters, story, he, seems, like, the kind, of, guy you, could easily talk, with, his last film tusk, in, my opinion, was, his worst film, the films, plot was, it, sounded, great, i, personally did not enjoy was, the pace, of, the film, the characters, at, least, that, ...]",-0.022872012086205634,0.1183048378137459,1,1,3

Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role.

Yojimbo (1961) - IMDb, Average Akira,FilmOtaku7,July/2005,5/10,"""Yojimbo"", Japanese for ""bodyguard"" is the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake, (Mifune) a samurai without a master or anyone to protect who walks into a small Japanese village that is rife with violence caused by two feuding groups. The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it.""Yojimbo"" was later remade into ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective ""heroes"". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Rashomon"" or ""High and Low"". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that ""Yojimbo"" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception.

Zoom (2006) - IMDb, Classic slapstick Allen and Chase,DocVW15,February/2007,8/10,"I actually watched this movie before I read any of the reviews or comments on this site which is rare for me; I tend to value the reviews and rankings of the other members. This is the first time I am left scratching my head wondering what exact movie did you people watch to give it such low reviews??!! This movie is what it is and a very good job of it. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. Take a bitter misfit ex-superhero who can't be any less interested in training new recruits and make it funny. Zoom has his reasons to be bitter and they are CLEARLY explained, if people don't get the plot, they weren't really paying attention. The acting in this movie is very good by a well collected cast. Allen and Chase deliver slapstick one liners throughout the whole movie that are truly reminiscent of their comedic classic styles. If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. The rest of the cast works very well together and even though there is a lot of predictability in the movie, it is still very funny and worth the watch. This is not a literary classic brought to life, so don't expect it to be. The negative comments about Allen are unjust, as his character wasn't' that far off from his style in the Santa Clause movies. This movie was enjoyable and I laughed out loud many times and I don't do that often with movies because they just aren't as funny in the same style.

Zoom (2006) - IMDb," Oh, for a kid's movie, you need to give it a break",Smells_Like_Cheese27,February/2007,5/10,"I rented this movie for my cousin, it was his pick and we watched it as soon as we got home, he loved it! I seriously was expecting this big travesty of a film with the way the users are talking about it on IMDb, but I have to honestly say that it wasn't THAT bad, come on, it's a kid's movie, what did you expect? Citizen Kane? For the kids it had a fun plot and cool visuals, yeah, the story was a little lame, but as adults we should know that this movie was not meant for us, so I am going to judge it on being a children's movie.These kids all have super powers, but don't know how to use them effectively, so the program of Zoom is going to help them become super heroes with a man who was a former celebrity type of hero who is now a has-been. They enjoy being kids with each other and learn how to use their powers in the right ways and must destroy Conor, another former super hero who went bad. Together they all must learn to a team and also a family.Like I said, for a kid's movie, it's cute and it really wasn't a BAD movie, I've seen worse, believe me! So don't use most of these comments as your judgment factor, see how the kids react and really judge for yourself, it's a fun little flick that I wouldn't watch again, but I think it will be a fun small classic somewhere down the road for the children.5/10",0,"[rent, movie, cousin, pick, watch, soon, get, home, love, seriously, expect, big, travesty, film, way, user, talk, imdb, honestly, say, bad, come, kid, movie, expect, citizen, kane, kid, fun, plot, cool, visuals, yeah, story, little, lame, adult, know, movie, meant, u, go, judge, child, kid, super, power, know, use, effectively, program, zoom, go, help, become, super, hero, man, former, celebrity, type, hero, enjoy, kid, learn, use, power, right, way, must, destroy, conor, another, former, super, hero, go, bad, together, must, learn, team, also, say, kid, movie, cute, really, bad, movie, see, bad, believe, use, comment, judgment, factor, see, kid, react, ...]","[i, rented, this movie, for, my cousin, it, was, his pick and we, watched, it, as soon, as, we, got, home, he, loved, it, i, seriously was expecting, this big travesty, of, a film, with, way, the users, are talking, about, it, on, imdb, i, have, to, honestly say, that, it, was, not, that, bad, come, on, it, is, a kid, movie, did, you, expect, citizen kane, for, the kids it, had, a fun plot, cool visuals, the story, was, a little lame, as, adults we, should know, that, this movie, was not meant, for, us, so i, am going, to, judge, it, on being, a children, movie.these, kids, all have, super powers, do not know, how, to, use, them, effectively, so, the program, zoom is going, to, help, them, become, super heroes, with, a man, was, a former celebrity type, of, hero, is, now, ...]",0.1405120839434589,0.13827457504505064,0,2,2
xXx: State of the Union (2005) - IMDb, Action-packed!!!,darkstar_ae16,May/2005,7/10,"From the creators of ""Die Another Day""! XXX: The Next Level as released on the Philippines.Having said that, it wouldn't be a surprise that this movie was just one action scene after another. Although a lot of negative feedbacks are here about the plot and the characters this movie is sure to satisfy the typical action movie fanatic. True to the reputation of that aforementioned James Bond movie there never was a dull moment in the movie. The pace and the tension of this movie just keeps the story flowing with slight stops to help you catch your breath and ingest the movie if aren't trashing it already.I admit that upon seeing Ice Cube as the one to play the role of the new Triple X I was skeptical about his capabilities. Having the typical role of a bad-ass, the attitude and situations really suit him. I wasn't totally disappointed. However, it was sort of a plot hole for them to consider Xander Cage as being less of a character than Darius Stone. I actually didn't like that idea. I'm still confused whether their mention of the previous Triple X being killed as a cover up or a fact. Hey, this is a gov't agency! One can never assume.As usual for most action movies this is another marketing scheme for brand products from Ice Cube's backpack to his gadgets and, of course, the hot cars, which I admit are the top of the line.If you're just another movie fanatic after a good rush this movie is for you - bang for your buck. But for the discriminating movie fan this will hardly satisfy you. I actually liked this movie regardless of the whole lame plot.

xXx: State of the Union (2005) - IMDb, xXx2: Coma State,pkeevers30,April/2005,2/10,"A film that should be retitled xXx2: Don't Say We Didn't Warn You.Opening with an impressive first 7-8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences.Ice Cube will never be thanking the academy (he at times look like he would struggle to play himself), but the Razzie committee should be on the lookout for this up and comer, this type of dribble is the cinematic equivalent of being run over repeatedly by a truck with the stereo cranked up to 11.The first xXx was at least assure of itself, popcorn action with the acknowledgment that it was bang for buck and nothing more. State of The Union takes itself far too seriously with a plot so absurd you swear it was written by a focus group of 13 year old boys after a binge at McDonalds. Action sequences are spaced every ten minutes or so as bookends to move Cube onto the next dilemma, each new sequence becoming further and further detached from reality (the final twenty minutes is utter insanity that makes films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle seem like documentaries). A sequence involving a train should be parody material, not a serious plot device.Samuel L Jackson cashes in his paycheck and plods through the movie looking as though he just read the script and realized what he has got himself involved in. Scott Speedman's looks too immature to play a senior NSA agent and is largely in the film so the white folks don't feel left out. Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and X-Zibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3: Turkey Season.Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against (sometimes at the same time) all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.My only positive comment on this whole debacle are the cars used in the film, not being a car enthusiast even I had to be quietly impressed by the rides in this film. Also this film is under the 2 hour mark a sign of a film that does know when its wearing out its welcome.Hopefully with the resoundingly negative response xXx2 has currently received another sequel looks unlikely, as films like this are about as satisfying as a having your nose broken.",0,"[film, retitled, say, warn, impressive, first, minute, film, move, cookie, cutter, territory, frighten, speed, continues, derail, opportunity, audience, engage, ridiculous, plot, heavily, computer, generate, action, cube, never, thank, academy, time, look, like, would, struggle, play, razzie, committee, lookout, comer, type, dribble, cinematic, equivalent, run, repeatedly, truck, stereo, cranked, first, xxx, least, assure, popcorn, action, acknowledgment, bang, buck, nothing, state, union, take, far, seriously, plot, absurd, swear, write, focus, group, year, old, boy, binge, mcdonalds, action, sequence, space, every, ten, minute, bookend, move, cube, onto, next, dilemma, new, sequence, become, detach, reality, final, twenty, minute, utter, insanity, make, film, like, charlie, ...]","[a film, that should be retitled, do not say, we, did not warn, with, impressive first, 7-8 minutes, this film moves, into, cookie cutter territory, at, a frightening speed, continues, to, derail, any opportunity, for, the audience, to, engage, in, the ridiculous plot, heavily computer, generated, action sequences.ice cube, will never be thanking, the academy, he, at, times, look, like, he, would struggle, to, play, himself, the razzie committee, should be, on, the lookout, for, this up, comer, this type, of, dribble, is, the cinematic equivalent, of being run, over, repeatedly, by, a truck, with, the stereo, cranked, up to, 11.the, first xxx, was at, least, assure, of, itself, popcorn action, with, the acknowledgment, that, it, was bang, for, buck and nothing, more, state, of, the union, takes, itself, far too seriously, with, a plot, so absurd you, swear, it, was written, by, a focus group, of, year, old boys, after, a binge, at, mcdonalds, action sequences, are spaced, every ten minutes, so, ...]",-0.12005877076304382,0.08607939503170299,1,1,3
